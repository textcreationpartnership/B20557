            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p n="1">§. <hi>1.</hi> THE reading <hi>T. E</hi>'s defence of his former mistakes, recalled to my mind the old Apologue, of the Passenger, who came to a certain Bridge where every one was to pay a Penny for each di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease he had, before he might pass over, and refusing to pay his Fine for an apparent disease, he struggled so long till two more were disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that were unsuspected before; so that at last he was forced to pay for three instead of one, and his infirmities which might have been concealed, were only made more publick by this unreasonable opposition. <hi>Caussin.</hi> Parab. Hist. l. <hi>3. 71.</hi> And truly my Adversary hath clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his blots with blurred Fingers, and made all his faults worse, while he attempted to mend them, for he hath vindicated himself from that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and dishonesty I charged him with before, by so many fresh instances, that his very Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy proves his Crimes, and confirms the justice of my Accusation: And that the Argument may not be too much interrupted by the frequent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations hereof, which his Book every where affords, I shall sum up a few of the principal evidences of that nature in this <hi>Introduction;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:200297:3"/> and because his own words do best describe his qualifications and manner of writing, I will venture to present him with his own Picture drawn by his own hand, though perhaps it may have the same effect upon him, that a Looking-glass had upon Old <hi>Lais,</hi> when she saw her wrinkles there, who fell into a rage at the sight of her own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, and broke the Glass, because it shewed her such a face (not as she wished, but) as she really had<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Julian. Anthol.</hi> l. <hi>6.</hi> c. <hi>8.</hi> Sed cùm faedus accesseris &amp; faedum ibi te videris, noli specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, non te fallit specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, tu te noli fallere. <hi>Aug.</hi> de Temp. <hi>235.</hi>
               </note> The People did not like the Picture which the <hi>Graecian</hi> Lymner had drawn by their own direction, however he writ upon it, <hi>This was the Peoples Draught;</hi> and so may I upon these Characters, <hi>T. E.</hi> Fecit.</p>
            <p n="2">§. <hi>2.</hi> ANd First let it be observed, that he seldom accuses me for any pretended fault, of which himself is not really guilty, and which he doth not commit in this very Book in which my Charge is contained. He taxes me for Pride, <hi>pag. 4,</hi> &amp;c. and my describing the <hi>English</hi> Clergy as more Learned than the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, is reckoned among my Brags, Insults, and Vaunts, but sure (as the Comoedian speaks) <hi>If I were worthy of this reproach, yet is he, of all others, the least fit to charge me;</hi> since his own Pride and Self-conceit is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently visible in all those Pages of his Book, where he tires his Reader, while he pleases himself with large repetitions of what he hath proved, and with great Characters of his mighty perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, and he seldom goes on twenty Leaves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, without standing still a while to admire himself, <hi>pag. 57. pag. 96, 145, 173, 194,
<pb facs="tcp:200297:3"/> 210, 248, 251,</hi> &amp;c. But his Pride is written in <hi>Capital Letters</hi> on his <hi>Title</hi> Page, and since the Quakers name their own Brats, we may be sure the name was of his own giving. His for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer heap of Self-baffling falshoods, was humbly stiled, <hi>Truth</hi> Prevailing: and this feeble Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is with equal modesty called, <hi>The Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Tithes shaken;</hi> That a Quaker should <hi>shake,</hi> is no marvel, and that in his <hi>shaking fit</hi> he should think all about him trembled too, is not very strange, that men of no Principles should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to shake Foundations, is probable enough. But that those <hi>Foundations</hi> which have stood so many Ages, and endured so many stronger Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries without the least harm, should be shaken by this <hi>Pot-Gun,</hi> is incredible; the poor blind Mole may as soon be believed to have shaken the <hi>Foundations</hi> of a well built Castle, when she hath cast up a little heap of dirt beside the Wall, as <hi>T. E.</hi> be thought to have shaken the <hi>Foundation of Tithes</hi> by a Book, wherein he hath only sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his own credit: But if <hi>you</hi> will take his own <hi>Testimony</hi> of his own <hi>Exploits,</hi> he hath both <hi>shaken</hi> the <hi>Foundation of Tithes,</hi> and (done far more) <hi>removed the four principal Posts on which a nameless Author set his pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Right to them.</hi> 'Tis well for the Author he was nameless, and out of the way, or else 'tis to be feared his Name had been buried in the ruins of his own Building, which <hi>T. E.</hi> hath le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled at one blow. But I pray, what were these <hi>Posts</hi> which this mighty man hath removed? Truly, no less than <hi>Divine Institution, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Practice, Voluntary Donation,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:200297:4"/>
               <hi>Positive Laws.</hi> And, <hi>First,</hi> This is not the only <hi>Divine Institution,</hi> which Quakers have attempted to remove, even <hi>Baptism</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Supper,</hi> which all Christians in the World own as the <hi>Institutions</hi> of <hi>Jesus,</hi> this sort of men (with <hi>Jews, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi>) do quite remove from their whole <hi>Party,</hi> and would (were it in their power) banish them out of the World; but when <hi>He</hi> that <hi>Instituted</hi> them comes to enquire how <hi>His Ordinances</hi> were observed, they that break these <hi>Commandments,</hi> and teach men so, will know what they and their Champion <hi>T. E.</hi> deserve, for removing <hi>Divine Institutions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Primitive Practice</hi> also the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers must remove as far out of sight as they can, lest it upbraid their new devices as perfect contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the purest Ages; and truly, if they could remove the notice of <hi>Primitive Practice</hi> from our Observation, as far as they have done their own waies from the imitation of it, they would have good cause to glory in that impious action, as the security of their ridiculous inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, Voluntary Donation:</hi> which (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be to God) cannot be revoked by him that made it, and yet <hi>T. E.</hi> hath removed this also: What <hi>Ananias</hi> got by such removing, <hi>Acts 5.</hi> we all know. But this remover can disanul the Will of the Dead, and blow away the Practices of past Ages, and Cancel the Laws of this, and boast of it when he hath done; for his <hi>Last</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move is, the removing <hi>Positive Laws,</hi> which the Supreme Authority had fixed. 'Tis well for
<pb facs="tcp:200297:4"/> the Quakers that they have such a Friend, who hath quite removed those severe Laws under which they so often smarted for their obstinacy, let them never complain hereafter of their suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by these Laws, for <hi>T. E.</hi> hath removed them or belyed himself, for he saith the <hi>Positive Laws</hi> (for Tithes) are removed, if you ask, Where? he tells you, In a Reply to my Book; if you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, By whom? he saith, by <hi>Thomas Elwood;</hi> so that he hath Indicted himself by Name for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving, that is, subverting the Laws, and what he deserves for that, our Statutes will acquaint him; and doubtless, if he had as really done this Fact, as he vainly boasts of it, he might guess whether his next remove might be: For since our Magistrates who are the <hi>Custodes Legum,</hi> punish such as only break the Laws once, surely they would not let him escape, if they believed he had removed them. But — <hi>Non compos</hi> will save him, for he only in a boasting Freak of Enthusiastick Frenzy, hath accused himself to have killed a man that is still alive, and to have removed those Laws, which stand yet, and are like to do (I hope) so long as the Nation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures. And (what ever swelling words are in his vain Title) who ever judiciously reads his Book, will acquit him from the guilt of having actually removed any one of these, so that he is only to account for the malice of intending it, and the pride of bragging of it; his weakness suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently securing him against all possibility of further mischief, and therefore I reckon it among the instances of his extraordinary self-conceit. As I do also his comparing himself to the famous
<pb facs="tcp:200297:5"/>
               <hi>Luther</hi> in the next Page; nay, to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduct. <hi>p. 1.</hi> as if his writing against Tithes had the same effects that the Preaching of the Apostle had against <hi>Paganism,</hi> or of the great Reformer against Popery. But though it was witty enough in <hi>Erasmus</hi> by that fancy to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend <hi>Luther,</hi> yet it is very foolish in <hi>T. E.</hi> to apply it so grosly in his own praise, and to tell us how he had pincht the Priests as severely as as ever <hi>Luther</hi> did the <hi>Monks,</hi> for the Wise man saith, <hi>Let another man praise thee, and not thy own mouth,</hi> Prov. <hi>xxvii. 2.</hi> But he cannot forbear bragging, <hi>That I found my</hi> Diana <hi>totter by a Stroke from the last Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his former Book, and was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive of greater danger, if timely course were not taken,</hi> pag. <hi>2.</hi> when yet he confesses, that I look upon him with all the contempt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, <hi>pag. 4.</hi> 'Tis strange he should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be revered for audaciously undertaking a thing so much above his capacity, and 'tis as unlikely I should fear the attempt of one whom I knew to be so despicable. This tottering there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was the effect of a Quaking in his own head, and the danger a Vaunt of his own inventing: But how large Epithetes soever he bestows on his own pains, I and my Brother Priest, with our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, are by this humble man thus modestly treated, of him he cries out, <hi>Poor weak man!</hi> pag. <hi>6.</hi> and of me ironically, <hi>This wise man,</hi> pag. <hi>211.</hi> yea, looking down on me with great pity (for I am little <hi>David</hi> now, and he great <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah) How hard</hi> (saith he) <hi>is this poor man put to it to piece up something that
<pb facs="tcp:200297:5"/> might look a little like a proof,</hi> pag. <hi>128.</hi> and no marvel, for <hi>pag. 373.</hi> he (with great scorn) saith, <hi>I talk idly, and that my Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is enough to render me suspected for a Natural,</hi> pag. <hi>473. and that I may return to my</hi> A, B, C. <hi>pag. 422.</hi> Again, he questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>Whether I understand the nature of a Gospel Ministry?</hi> p. <hi>301.</hi> And well he might, if it be true which he saies, <hi>That I abound with Confusion, and have little strength of sound Argument, or force of solid Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> p. <hi>2.</hi> and that in one whole Section, <hi>There is not one solid Stone of Truth, or firm Pillar of Reason,</hi> p. <hi>58.</hi> And my Friend's Book he saith, <hi>Is all of it either unguarded, or ill guarded,</hi> p. <hi>13.</hi> a Censure that none would pass but <hi>T. E.</hi> who is so full of his own praises, that he hath no room for a good thought of any other man or his work. Nor can we much admire at this Treatment, since he deals no better with the Fathers, when they oppose his conceits; thus the Learned <hi>Origen</hi> is rejected with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, <hi>p. 69.</hi> though he be a good witness when he speaks <hi>T. E</hi>'s sense, <hi>p. 274. Et sapit &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum facit.</hi> St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s opinion is rejected with scorn, <hi>p. 437.</hi> yea, and all that think as he thinks, <hi>Are in danger</hi> (he saith) <hi>to be begged,</hi> that is, <hi>for fools,</hi> p. <hi>438.</hi> and yet what St. <hi>Augustine</hi> thinks and saies there, is cited with approbation by his often commended Dr. <hi>Willet,</hi> and by a whole Council together in which <hi>Arnulphus</hi> the Emperour presided, and it consisted of the three great Archbishops of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> nineteen Bishops, with innumerable Priests
<pb facs="tcp:200297:6"/> and Deacons, and many of the Lay-Nobility, <hi>Concil.</hi> Tribur. <hi>c. 13. ap.</hi> Bin. <hi>Tom. 3. p. 2.</hi> Had <hi>T. E.</hi> been then alive, it had been a better Trade than Speaking to the Quakers, to have begged all these mens Estates, especially if he could as easily have proved as called them, Fools.

Now what he deserves for that which relates to others, I am content the Reader should judge.

<pb facs="tcp:200297:8"/> him, Learned, I had abused him indeed, as will appear when we have shewed his Reading and Skill in Authors; his knowledge of History, Chronology, Antiquity, and the like: Some little Learning the Quakers thought he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and (I hear) they brag he hath shewed much more now, which ignorant Vaunt sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proves them an illiterate Sect; for, as <hi>Suidas</hi> observes, <hi>Acamathius</hi> passed for a Philosopher, though destitute of all Learning; but it was only in his own Town of <hi>Heliopolis,</hi> where scarce any man could read. <hi>Verb.</hi> Acamath. <hi>p. 42.</hi> But whatever they think, <hi>T.

But we must not enlarge upon all his Follies, let it suffice to note briefly; That <hi>p. 181.</hi> he reckons a silly, shameless, and known forgery of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Council at <hi>Sinuessa,</hi> among the Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Councils of the Primitive Church: That <hi>p 191.</hi> he knows not where to look for a known Story, that all who have skill in the Councils can go directly to: nor did he know what to make of two Quotations out of the Civil Law in the Page before: And does he expect I should reach him who knows all things? He quarrels at my Translating, <hi>p. 179.</hi> and yet he (though Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar seem his only Science) ridiculously <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishes</hi>

What Master would not whip a School-boy for translating, <hi>Civis Londinensis, A Citizen of Londinensis?</hi> Nor is his skill greater in Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology, wherein he is so pert, as out of <hi>Burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galensis,</hi> and <hi>Fasciculus Temporum</hi> to correct my Dates of Councils, taken out of the most exact ancient and modern Computations, blaming me sometimes for a difference of four years only, <hi>p. 179.</hi> And yet he himself misses above two hundred years at once in the date of <hi>Theophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact</hi>'s death, <hi>p. 50.</hi> and computes <hi>Prosper</hi>'s time to be fifty years after St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi> when they lived the greatest part of their time together, and <hi>Prosper</hi> out-lived St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> but twenty five years; for St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> died <hi>An. 430.</hi> and <hi>Prosper 455. pag. 172.</hi> Again, <hi>pag. 235.</hi> he mentions a Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Ethelbald</hi>'s, and saith it is above fifty years older than <hi>Ethelwolf</hi>'s, and so indeed it is, and he is an exact Computer too, for <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald</hi>'s Charter was made in the year <hi>749.</hi> and <hi>Ethelwolfe</hi>'s, <hi>An. 855.</hi> that is, above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years older than <hi>Ethelwolse</hi>'s. The truth is, he deals only in Modern Authors, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes <hi>Eusebius</hi> by <hi>Fox</hi> his Martyrology: St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> and St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> or <hi>Origen</hi> by <hi>Brute</hi> and <hi>Thorp;</hi> or at best by <hi>Fulk</hi> and <hi>Willet,</hi> or <hi>Perkins,</hi> and these often wilfully perverted too, where-ever these Authors misled him, he is inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of discerning it: and where they leave him, he can say nothing to the purpose. <hi>p. 169.</hi> how
<pb facs="tcp:200297:10"/> miserably he gropes about a place in St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi> which <hi>Selden</hi> saith nothing against; so again, <hi>p. 190, 191. 192.</hi> where <hi>Selden</hi> is si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, his Inspiration fails him. He presumes also, <hi>p. 161.</hi> to give the sense of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> whose Book he never saw, for though he tells us, <hi>They that fairly consult the place will easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see I mist his meaning.</hi> 'Tis evident <hi>T. E.</hi> could not see this himself, for observe how fairly he had consulted the place, <hi>His words</hi> (saith he) <hi>as I find them in</hi> Selden<hi>'s Review,</hi> &amp;c. So that he fairly consults them at second-hand, and though he never read the whole Discourse, presumes to correct me that had; which was very modestly done. He flourishes sometimes, as if he cited the Ancients, but can go no further than some modern Authors lead him; nor can he cite any more of St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s Sermon than <hi>Selden</hi> had collected to his hand, <hi>p. 171.</hi> He brings in <hi>Origen, Syricius,</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> the First, <hi>p. 274.</hi> but all out of <hi>Perkins</hi> by meer Retail, and yet, <hi>p. 6.</hi> because he cited <hi>Gauden</hi> for <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micus,</hi> He is angry we will not believe he did read that passage in <hi>Gauden,</hi> as if he never quoted any Author which he had not seen, or as if <hi>Fisher</hi> had not enabled him to quote <hi>Gauden.</hi> But all this will not hide his gross ignorance, for if both <hi>Fisher</hi> and <hi>Gauden</hi>'s Printer had read it <hi>Fimicus,</hi> a very ordinary Schollar would have corrected it <hi>Firmicus</hi> in Transcribing, any Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary-Keeper, or Auctioner could have done that. He saies, it cannot be doubted (by any that understands Books) that many men of note in several Ages have accounted Tithes Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,
<pb facs="tcp:200297:11"/>
               <hi>p. 87.</hi> An Assertion that convinces all Schollars that <hi>T. E.</hi> doth not understand Books at all, so that he may reasonably enough doubt of that which he so falsly and boldly affirms. Some lesser Evidences there are of his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which need not have been produced, if he that charges me with <hi>Soloecisms</hi> had not given us such grounds to believe, that nothing is too absurd to fall from his Pen. His calling the silence of a prophane Author, <hi>p. 34. Scripture silence,</hi> is somewhat odd, and shews how little difference Quakers make between holy Scripture and <hi>Pagan</hi> Books, his putting the <hi>vulgar Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation</hi> for the usual <hi>English</hi> Version, <hi>p. 67.</hi> is somewhat strange. His making a doubt whether Christian Princes be Christian Princes, <hi>p. 233.</hi> and his saying that the Christians of old (whom I supposed Christians already and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired too) needed a Gospel Ministry to make them Christians, <hi>pag. 110, 111.</hi> may be cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled. And <hi>p. 241.</hi> he tells of some <hi>who were corrupt in Doctrine, corrupt in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, corrupt in Life, corrupt in Manners;</hi> and yet Practice, Life and Manners in this sense are all one, and he makes a distinction where there is no difference. These with many more of of this kind we will pass by, and now submit it to any competent judgment whether <hi>T. E.</hi> have any Learning at all. It may be some will say what is it to the Question whether he have any or not? I answer, doubtless 'tis very much to the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to know whether he that writes upon it be fit to do it or no. As for the Divine Institution, Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> was so modest as to protest, <hi>p. 2. He
<pb facs="tcp:200297:11"/> did not write his Book to prove that Tithes are not due by the Law of God.</hi> And <hi>pag. 14</hi> he saith, <hi>Divines must determine that point whether they be due</hi> Jure Divino <hi>or not;</hi> yet here is one who is neither Divine, Lawyer, nor so much as a Schollar, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes he is able to determine it in the Negative. As for the other three Branches, <hi>Primitive Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, Voluntary Donation,</hi> and <hi>Positive Laws,</hi> no man can write of them to purpose without the knowledge of Fathers, Councils, Histories, and Laws; and a practicing <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanks</hi> Zany, who never read a Physick Book, may as well dispute a Medic Question with a Studyed Physician; or he that never saw a piece of Common Law, plead with a Studied and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised Lawyer; as <hi>T.

Again, <hi>p. 21.</hi> he leaves out these material words in the middle of a sentence cited from me—<hi>for he needs not our goods himself,</hi> Psal. <hi>16.</hi> ver. <hi>2.</hi> which words are the reason and proof of my assertion. And indeed 'tis one of his black Arts, to hide my Reasonings and my Proofs, by mangling my sentences (as he doth notoriously <hi>pag. 80.</hi>) and then cries out I beg the Question. So <hi>p. 263.</hi> he pretends to cite me, but with a cunning line — hides the main strength of my Discourse. Nor is he one jot honester as to his own words when they pinch him, or stand in his way, for he denies or conceals them to serve a present turn: How fiercely he quarrels at me for charging him with saying, Abraham <hi>paid Tithes;</hi> whereas in one Page of his first Book, <hi>p. 280.</hi> he uses that very word <hi>[paid and pay]</hi> three times: so for all his railing fits at me for putting in the word
<pb facs="tcp:200297:13"/>
               <hi>[particular] p. 116.</hi> these are his own words, <hi>pag. 319.</hi> of his first Book, <hi>He that appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a maintenance in general, describes also that maintenance in particular.</hi> Again, when he would cover his flattering the Impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators, and exasperating them against us; in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his words, <hi>p. 262.</hi> he leaves out these, <hi>I need not (I suppose) tell the Impropriators that this concerns them.</hi> Doubtless he is baffled sufficiently, who is thus driven to eat his own words, both in these and other instances I could give: But it may be thought he takes greater liberty with my words and his own than he will do with others, there we may expect strict honesty from him that taxes me with the least ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental alteration; yet even there also he takes so wicked a freedom, as not to value how he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters either the words or sense of any Authors, or what he adds or omits to serve his ends of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, wherein his Knavery is much aggravated with strange impudence, to quote Authors falsly against the Priests, who have both books and skill to discover him, however he may impose up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his blind Quakers. To come to particulars, <hi>pag. 35.</hi> he quotes his great Master <hi>Selden</hi> to prove the Gentiles had the opinion of Tithes from the later Jews, and not from <hi>Abraham</hi> or the ancient Patriarchs; whenas the next words to those he cites, are, <hi>Neither is it unlikely that the ancient and most known example of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>gave the first ground both to them and the</hi> Europaeans, <hi>so sometimes to dispose the Tenth of their Spoils of War to holy uses;</hi> Seld. cap. <hi>3.</hi> p. <hi>34.</hi> which the Quaker
<pb facs="tcp:200297:13"/> designedly omitted to abuse his Reader. Indeed no Author can escape his fingers; poor <hi>Willet</hi>'s mouth is stopt in the middle of a sentence, <hi>p. 91. This provision for the Church maintenance by paying of Tithes is the most safe</hi>— [here <hi>T. E.</hi> gags him, but the Doctor being set at liberty goes on] <hi>indifferent, and surest way, and no better can come in the place thereof: which he proves by three Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, 1. It is most equal to have every thing in kind, according to the Apostle's Rule</hi> Gal. <hi>6.</hi> ver. <hi>6.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>2. It enables them to be hospitable, 1</hi> Tim. <hi>3.2. 3. It is more or less as God giveth increase to the fruits of the earth, which is the most equal and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent way.</hi> But the Quakers were not to see this, <hi>Elwood</hi> hath his <hi>Index Expurgatorius,</hi> as well as the Papists, and gelds Authors as well as they. <hi>Pag. 92.</hi> He puts another falshood on the good Doctor, saying, <hi>He shews he understood the</hi> Moguntine <hi>Synod so; that is, That Tithes depended on Positive Laws:</hi> which is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently false; for <hi>Willet</hi> only cites that Council thus, <hi>Synod. Mogunt. c. 7. Statuimus ut de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimae quae jure debentur divino, solvantur sine fraude:</hi> (And then adds) <hi>This Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil doubteth not to affirm Tithes to be due by the Word of God.</hi> But as he cites <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> the oftnest, so he abuses him the most; and the Reader will easily believe he doth so, if he consider that <hi>T. E.</hi> cites his <hi>Demonstration of the Problem,</hi> to prove that Popery was ancienter in the Church than either the Opinion or Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Tithes: Now the Problem which <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:200297:14"/> writes that Book to demonstrate, is this, <hi>It is impossible for any Popish Divine in the World to shew out of the genuine Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Councils and Fathers, and out of their genuine sense, that the Faith of the present Roman Church, where it differs from the Reformed Churches, is truly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick.</hi> And by Catholick he understands <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved every where, always, and by all,</hi> as <hi>Lirinensis</hi> doth. And indeed the whole design of the Book is to prove Popery is not ancient, nor was not universal; and his final conclusion, <hi>p 244.</hi> is, <hi>No Apostle, no holy Father, nor Orthodox Person, for 1200 years after Christ, did ever so think or teach as to all the Principles and Fundamentals of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>in the</hi> Trent <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil now Thinks and Teacheth.</hi> And is it not very unlikely that <hi>T. E.</hi> could honestly bring matter out of this Book to prove Popery received in the Church within <hi>200</hi> years after Christ? Ʋnless <hi>Perkins</hi> were as vain as <hi>T. E.</hi> and writ on purpose to confute the Question he was to prove, it cannot be but he is basely abused, to be brought in, as building that which he destroys; and I do affirm <hi>T. E.</hi> hath shamefully perverted his words and sense, and dishonestly concealed that which is <hi>Perkins</hi> his meaning. Nay, I dare undertake to prove out of the same Chapters (whence <hi>T. E.</hi> picks up sentences to make Popery seem received so early in the Church) that <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> flatly denies it was then received; but at present a few plain instances shall confirm this, <hi>Pag. 174.</hi> He cites <hi>Perkins</hi> to prove <hi>that the
<pb facs="tcp:200297:14"/> opinion of Purgatory was received and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in the Church about 200 years after Christ;</hi> and saith Perkins <hi>confesses both</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian <hi>and</hi> Origen <hi>held it,</hi> Problem. p. <hi>175.</hi> But note <hi>Perkins</hi>'s words are, <hi>Purgatory in the Church was first received by</hi> Tertullian <hi>the</hi> Montanist (that is the Quaker) <hi>and</hi> Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, <hi>but this last would have it in this life.</hi> Whence we see the whole Church did not believe it, nor any but these two in the Church, and one of these was an Enthusiastick Heretick when he did speak of it, and the others Purgatory was no Popish Purgatory, which <hi>pag. 180.</hi> the same <hi>Perkins</hi> saith, <hi>was not received by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, unless perhaps after 600 years, and that the foundation of Popish Purgatory was not received of the Learned in the Church for 1100 years after Christ.</hi> And now doth <hi>Perkins</hi> prove that Popish Purgatory was belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Church in <hi>Origen</hi>'s time? Or is he a fit witness for this bold man to bring in to prove a Church corrupted with Popery <hi>200</hi> years after Christ? And that he uses him thus in all those citations, <hi>p. 174</hi> and <hi>175.</hi> I well shew in its proper place, noting only that in his last in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, <hi>p. 175.</hi> he gives us as <hi>Perkins</hi>'s words, <hi>The single life of Priests began to be preacht up by, or before the year 300:</hi> whereas his words are quite different, viz. <hi>The marriage of Priests for 300 years after Christ was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where free, without any interdict or vow of perpetual Continence.</hi> And in that very Chapter <hi>Perkins</hi> brings a sentence out of <hi>Origen</hi> to prove, <hi>that the Testimonies of
<pb facs="tcp:200297:15"/> the Ancients about the single life of Priests, were private opinions and conjectures:</hi> It seems to me, saith <hi>Origen,</hi> &amp;c.— <hi>p. 198. T. E.</hi> stole the rest of this sentence out of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> p. <hi>274.</hi> and left out the words that intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it (which would have discovered the cheat) citing it for an evidence, that this was the common opinion of those times: Thus <hi>Cacus</hi>-like he draws his stollen goods backwards into his Den, that we might not discern whence he had taken them, but his thievery and injustice cannot be concealed. Yet he will venture again, and custome is hard to cure, wherefore when he is blaming me for mis-citing <hi>Polydore Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> (whose words I did not pretend to quote, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set his Name in the Margin) He (though he says he gives us <hi>Polydore</hi>'s own words, <hi>p. 270.</hi>) omits two sentences; One in the bottom of <hi>p. 270.</hi> which signifies, <hi>Pelagius</hi> his decree was <hi>one of the most unreasonable things that ever the World had seen.</hi> Another in <hi>p. 271.</hi> he covers with a line— <hi>viz.</hi> shewing that S. <hi>Gregory</hi> thought that decree contrary to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, which commands to <hi>put away the Wife only for Fornication:</hi> both which <hi>T. E.</hi> thought made against his interest, and therefore shuts them under hatches. As he doth also the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rochester</hi>'s words, <hi>p. 276.</hi> which make Indulgences much later than Purgatory, and which <hi>Polydore</hi> there cites at large. Equally just we shall find him to be toward his great Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian <hi>Wernerus,</hi> the Author of <hi>Fasciculus temporum,</hi> for what he speaks of <hi>8</hi> Popes (that sate not ten years in all) <hi>viz.</hi> that nothing
<pb facs="tcp:200297:15"/> but what is scandalous can be found of them, <hi>T. E.</hi> applies to all the Popes after Pope <hi>Jone, pag. 305.</hi> yet of Pope <hi>Nicholas,</hi> who was but a little after her, that same Author saith, <hi>He was so holy that none since S.</hi> Gregory <hi>was to be compared to him.</hi> Again, in the next Page he keeps his hand in, by shifting a sentence of the same Authors, that plainly confutes the Quakers assertion of the Apostacy of the Roman Church before <hi>Ethelwolf;</hi> viz. <hi>What scandals do we read to have happened about these times even in the holy Apostolick Seat</hi>— (there <hi>T. E.</hi> stops, but the Author goes on) —<hi>which thou hast kept hitherto with so much zeal,</hi> (and a little after, where <hi>T. E.</hi> breaks off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain) <hi>Yet after these times there were many holy Popes,</hi> saith <hi>Wernerus,</hi> who is a great Bigot for S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair, and doubtless little thought to have been brought in for a Witness against it; but <hi>T. E.</hi> can make any man say any thing he hath a mind at this rate of quoting, as might be abundantly made out by many more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, but one undeniable instance shall suffice: In his 305th Page, the honest Quaker brings a long quotation out of <hi>Platina vit. Stephani 3.</hi> and impudently tells us <hi>that</hi> Platina <hi>saith all that of the times before</hi> Ethelwolf; nay, <hi>that he laments the wickedness of the times</hi> (well nigh an <hi>100</hi> years before <hi>Ethelwolf</hi>'s Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) in these words,—<hi>But now Devotion and Religion is grown so cold, &amp;c.</hi> which is as horrid a falshood as can be spoken: For let any man read the place, and he shall find <hi>Platina</hi> is highly commending the Devotion of those times,
<pb facs="tcp:200297:16"/> and shewing, <hi>how both the Pope himself, and all that were present, made their Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in a Procession with bare feet and great devotion from the</hi> Lateran <hi>Church to S.</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. <hi>But now,</hi> saith he (speaking of his own times, <hi>viz. Anno 1471.) Devotion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is grown so cold</hi> — and so on to the end of <hi>T. E</hi>'s long quotation, every word of which concerns <hi>Platina</hi>'s own times, that is, <hi>600</hi> years after <hi>Ethelwolf</hi>—and then the Historian goes on thus — <hi>I return to</hi> Stephen <hi>that most holy man,</hi> Platin. p. <hi>118.</hi> What is this but forging evidence, corrupting witness, false dating Records? For this could be no other but a deliberate and designed cheat, and is a fair demonstration that Quakers, who will not swear, will lye without scruple; and they that will not confirm the truth with an Oath in a good cause, will bear false-witness to make out a bad one: And <hi>T. E.</hi> in particular makes no scruple of speaking falsly for his own advantage, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance or two (out of many) shall demonstrate. Pag. <hi>194.</hi> he brags he hath proved before, <hi>that these Doctrines had prevailed in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>by the unquestionable evidence of Protestant Authors.</hi> And yet in the place which he refers to, <hi>p. 174.</hi> he names no Author but <hi>Perkins,</hi> whose evidence (as he hath abused it) is not only questionable, but easily disproved out of the same Book. So, <hi>p. 251.</hi> he vaunts he hath proved <hi>Ethelwolf</hi>'s Clergy, Popish, by the testimony of divers approved Authors, when as not one of his Authors ever spake such a word of them. Again, <hi>Pag. 302.</hi> he saith, <hi>The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
<pb facs="tcp:200297:16"/> of Christianity were shortly after here extinguished by</hi> Austin <hi>and his Sectators;</hi> which is as false a slander as can be invented, and which none but an hardened Quaker could have the confidence to affirm. Pag. <hi>338.</hi> he saith, <hi>Tithes were not counted cognizable by the Civil Magistrate, or subjected to Humane Laws for many hundred years after they were given.</hi> And <hi>p. 339. they made no provision for the payment of them, save by Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Censures, for some hundred of years,</hi> which is a notorious untruth, since in the <hi>Saxons</hi> time the Kings Laws ordered punishments for the detaining them, and the Civil Magistrate and Ecclesiastical sate together upon such Offenders, yea the King's Officer inflicted a Penalty on them. See King <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Laws, <hi>c. 3. An. 967. p. 1445.</hi> and <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror first sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated these two Tribunals, which joyntly proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against these Criminals before, and after too sometimes: <hi>Selden ad Eadmer. not. p. 166.</hi> and <hi>History of Tythes, p. 412, 413, &amp;c.</hi> which Book since <hi>T. E.</hi> had seen, this must needs be a wilful untruth on purpose to abuse his credulous Quakers. The rest of his falshoods are visible at first sight, as <hi>pag. 468. That some Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers have been sentenced to be hanged pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their Religion.</hi> Pag. <hi>500. The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers never neglected to crave a blessing upon their Meat:</hi> which all the Nation knows to be false. <hi>Pag. 480.</hi> He impudently saith, <hi>That Parish which is able to give most wages may have their choice of Priests, take them upon trial, and hire which they will:</hi> Whereas
<pb facs="tcp:200297:17"/> scarce any endowed Parishes in <hi>England</hi> have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such power to choose their Priests, for every one knows the Patron chooses for them; and God be praised, 'tis not <hi>Oliver</hi>'s days now, when Loyal Patrons were deprived of their Right, and a giddy multitude chose generally the very worst; here therefore <hi>T. E.</hi> speaks falsly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>And now I suppose the Reader is so fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of <hi>T. E</hi>'s honesty and integrity, that he will never see fit to trust him any more, and if he do deceive any after so fair warning on their part, and so full conviction on his, they deserve no pity: For <hi>by the</hi> Massilian <hi>Law, if a Slave deceived his Master above thrice, he was not to be punished;</hi> Al. ab Alex. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>20.</hi> But I cannot conclude this Section without a compassionate regard to the miserable Quakers who are led by such deceitful Guides, and take their very Falshoods for Divine Truths, and follow such dangerous Leaders as <hi>T. E.</hi> into the belief of the most absurd Opinions, and monstrous, yea, pernicious Errors: But I know they do not pity themselves; for 'tis the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of their misery that they perceive not how miserable they are: However I shall pray for them, and say, <hi>Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb facs="tcp:200297:17"/>§. <hi>6.</hi> BƲt to return to <hi>T. E.</hi> the last part of his Character shall be his Ingenuity in answering my Book: 'Tis a Turkish Maxim, <hi>In War scruple not Deceits;</hi> and my (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps unchristianed) Adversary takes his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures from that Rule. I am sure he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed nothing of a Christian or Man that enquired after Truth in this whole Argument, but only studied how to palliate his own mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes, and avoid my Reasons, by Methods as unfair as unworthy; but the Artifices he hath used to these ends are so various, that I must briefly rank them under a few heads, with two or three instances of each kind, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Introduction. First, I reckon his strange obstinacy and brutish resolution<note n="‖" place="margin">Humanum est errare, belluinum verò perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verare in errore. <hi>Cic.</hi>
               </note> never to own the least mistake, how plain soever the matter be, or how full soever the evidence be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him. Of which humour our Modern Popish Adversaries also are observed to be, who think themselves obliged to defend the most ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Opinions of their Church, not so much because they believe them, as because they would wound their beloved Infallibility, if they should confess they have erred in any thing. And 'tis not improbable that <hi>T. E</hi>'s inflexible obstinacy may proceed from a desire to be taken for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible among his Quakers, the credit of which would be much diminished by an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Error: But whatever his end be therein, I am sure all wise and good men account this base humour to be the effect of pride and folly,
<pb facs="tcp:200297:18"/> and want of a good Education<note n="†" place="margin">Hoc verò superbae stultitiae perseverantia est, Quod semel dixi, qualecunque est, fixum ratumque sit. <hi>Sen. de Benefic. l. 4▪ c. 38.</hi>
               </note>; none being more tenacious of their Sentiments than they, who are least able to defend them. But 'tis all one to <hi>T. E.; Fimicus</hi> shall be no mistake, <hi>p. 6.</hi> and that about S. <hi>Basil</hi> he will answer, if confidence or equivocation can bring him off; though only with his own party; though all the world besides see his shame through the thin <hi>Cypress</hi> he casts over it, and though he betrays his dishonesty while he is covering his ignorance, yet he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove blushing. He shews his face is of the same Metal with the Censers, <hi>p. 257.</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending that notorious Soloecism of the <hi>Censers changing their property when their Form was altered:</hi> Doubtless no other sort of men would have so stiffly stood to that false and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Position, <hi>That the Charge of maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ministry is heavier now on the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians than it was on the Jews of old,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all the evidence of Scripture and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son brought against that absurd assertion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the opinion and plain accounts of his great Masters, <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Selden,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the sense of all good Authors, <hi>p. 441.</hi> Was ever any thing more clearly made out, than the Quakers abuse of that place, <hi>Jer. 5.21. The Priests bear rule by their means:</hi> which they expound of bearing rule by their Wealth and Estates? Yet since one of <hi>T. E</hi>'s Friends is concerned in this absurdity, he tugs for four or five pages together <hi>505</hi> &amp;c. to help Dun
<pb facs="tcp:200297:18"/> out of the mire, and strangely expose himself to censure, while he so weakly excuses a fault that had been far less if he had ingenuously confessed it: But we must not expect any Volume of Retractations from <hi>T. E.</hi> Inspired Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, as well as infallible Romanists, must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver own an Error: And now we know his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, if he deny all that is charged upon him, the World will not wonder at it, nor think him the less guilty of what is so fully proved. But secondly, Another observation concerning his manner of answering, is, <hi>That to evade a Reply to what is material and direct to the Question, he wilfully wrests some ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual expressions, and diverts his Reader by large Harangues upon the sense he hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to them, and so avoids what he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not answer.</hi> Thus wherever he finds such words as these, <hi>The first Christians, The earliest days of Christianity, The very beginning of Christianity;</hi> which I never intended in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other sense than to signifie the Primitive Christians, and the Ages before Christianity was generally settled; and so Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> useth the phrase where he speaks <hi>of the Laws of the Church for Tithes from the beginning of Christianity,</hi> chap. <hi>6.</hi> p. <hi>119.</hi> Yet <hi>T. E. p. 176, 178, 206.</hi> and elsewhere, strains rare contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions out of them, and by strictly expounding them of the Apostles times, thereby evades all answer to the Primitive Practice, with which he knew he was pinched there. So, <hi>p. 197.</hi> my proof out of the <hi>British</hi> and <hi>Saxon Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:200297:19"/> of a certain proportion of Maintenance out of the Fruits of the Earth, enjoyned by Laws with great Penalties on every one to pay; he wipes off with this frivolous jest, <hi>That every one had not a crop of Corn growing:</hi> And then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them my Conceits, he waves them, because he saw they proved a fixed Maintenance, settled by Positive Law before <hi>Ethelwolf</hi>'s time, and utterly destroyed his voluntary and unfixed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. Again, when I proved an Office may be endowed as well as a private person, instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in the Mayor of a Corporation, and <hi>T. E.</hi> who claim under different Qualifications but one hath as good Temporal right for his time as the other: This he blunders, by saying, <hi>He sees not how they can claim under different Qualifications, since each of them claims as he is Mayor,</hi> p. <hi>335.</hi> Very strange! can he see no difference between his own Qualifications and those of a Mayor? Or doth he take him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be the Head of a Corporation? If he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me of what Town he is Mayor (though it be but of <hi>Gotham</hi>) I will promise him not to make him the Instance of a private person while he is Worshipful: But the freaks of this kind are too silly and too many to tire the Reader with, one more instance therefore shall suffice: How often and how vilely doth he strain the words of <hi>[Profits and Increase]</hi> which plainly signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and are commonly taken for all that is reaped from the Land of one years growth, and applies them to the Advantage that is made of a Crop after <hi>Deduction of the Seed, &amp;c.</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:200297:19"/> he knows is generally called <hi>[clear Profits]</hi> Yet on this idle Quibble he builds many seeming Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, <hi>p. 403.</hi> and elsewhere: Yea, <hi>p. 442.</hi> he puts this very trick upon the holy Scripture it self out of a gross ignorance, both of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal and the Jewish Custom, or else out of a wilfull mistake for his present ends, as I shall shew when I come to the Discourse: But here it shall suffice to observe that I dispute with great disadvantage against so shuffling an Adversary, who never stands his Ground, but returns seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Arguments with Cavils, Quibbles, or Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes of seeming Wit, and in the smoke of these makes his escape. Thirdly, Let it be noted that he generally inverts and confounds the order of my Discourse, skipping backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to break the method of my Arguments, that so they may never appear in their full strength. <hi>Divide and Overcome,</hi> is Satan's Motto, and <hi>T. E</hi>'s great Rule, which he pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises so often, that leaving the fuller discovery of his fallacious dealing therein to the following Book, one or two Examples may here serve to justifie the Charge. In his <hi>18</hi> and 19th Pages he begins with my 30th Page, and picks here and there till he come to pag. <hi>34.</hi> and then runs back to pag. <hi>26, 27,</hi> and <hi>21.</hi> And again, in his <hi>145, 146,</hi> 147th pages, he scrapes many loose Sentences together in this wild order, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with my 67th page, he goes back to my <hi>62, 63</hi> pages, and then forward again to <hi>68</hi> and <hi>69,</hi> and then backwards to my <hi>62, 63,</hi> and <hi>64</hi> pages, and then forwards once more to
<pb facs="tcp:200297:20"/> page <hi>70, 71, 69,</hi> and lastly retires to my <hi>62</hi> page: The like tricks he plays in his <hi>33</hi> page, and in his <hi>42,</hi> compared with his 44th page. Now what Book in the World might not be answered and rendered ridiculous at this rate? Or what honesty can he have, who where he is arguing puts this abuse upon his Adversary? The best carved Statue may become the Object of Laughter by placing the Head between the Leggs, and the Hands coming out of the back, and the Feet upon the Shoulders: He hath a bad Cause to manage who is driven to these shameful Artifices. Fourthly, I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, That though his Book be very large, as to be three times bigger than that he answers, and though he can find room in it for long impertinencies, vain repetitions, and nauseous Tautologies, yet a very great part of what was Material and Argumentative in my Book, is wholly passed by in silence, and is so far from being answered, that it is not at all men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: To prove which, let the Reader of his Book observe, How much Paper he wasts about the Date of Popery, which is all of it imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to the main Question; for if Popery had obtained in all other Points when Tithes were given, (as 'tis very certain it did not) yet it doth not follow that Tithes were Popish, since many Orthodox Fathers of old, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Reformed Protestants of late assert them lawful, and all Papists do not pay them, and many that do, think them not due by God's Law, and even in the worst times of Popery
<pb facs="tcp:200297:20"/> it self, many Orthodox Laws were made, and so may these Laws for Tithes be, although Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery should have generally been received when they were made. His ridiculous Nonsense of Tithes (which are the very Quantity of the Maintenance) being a Mode of that Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and a Circumstance of the Quantity, he repeats five or six times, <hi>62, 63, 65, 83, 95,</hi> fearing his weakness would not have been sufficiently exposed, if he had published it but in one place. His little bits of Wit about the Man without a name, can find room to be repeated page <hi>65, 86,</hi> &amp;c. And the adding <hi>[only]</hi> to express, not alter his sense, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be too often laid to my Charge, <hi>116, 117, 146 (aliàs 154.)</hi> How many dead lifts doth a definition of Popery (picked out of the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conference) serve him at? And whenever he can say nothing else, that long Quotation, and all his mistaken Inferences, are dished up anew, <hi>p. 194, 216, 251, 289.</hi> The like use doth he make of a longer Citation about the Date of Popery, which we have twice over at full length, <hi>p. 370, 413.</hi> The Catalogues of Romish Ware <hi>T. E.</hi> doth often set out to sale, and they fill up his Shop-board rarely when he wants other furniture, <hi>p. 219, 225, 227, 228, 241.</hi> The fancy of Profits and Increase was too good to be seen but once, therefore we have it <hi>p. 403, 439, 442.</hi> and the abuse he put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Sentence of <hi>Tithes being due out of the Profits only,</hi> is so odiously repeated in his last part, that few pages but have a
<pb facs="tcp:200297:21"/> touch of it: Yea, his very Authors sayings, if he think they be for his turn, shall be brought in again and again. Thus we have a Quotation out of <hi>Fox, p. 207,</hi> and <hi>297.</hi> out of <hi>Fulk, p. 90,</hi> and <hi>147;</hi> and so he serves <hi>Willet</hi> and <hi>Perkins</hi> at every turn, which shews him but a poor Retailer, who is forced to supply the poverty of his Stock by most ridiculous repetitions: And indeed his whole Book is so full of Tautologies and empty Words, that though the Reason of it be but small, the Bulk of it is very large, a drop of sense in an Ocean of Phrases, variety in expressing the same thing serving him instead of new Arguments, so that I may say (as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,) <hi>He never blushes, nor considers what but only how much he saies.</hi> But that which we are most to admire, is, that a man so prodigal of Words and Paper, and so able (in his own Opinion) to shake Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations; one that can find room to repeat im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies, should for fear of swelling his Pages, leave so great and so considerable a part of my Book unanswered, especially since he boasts he hath removed all my Post, I expected not to have found one piece of this Building undemolished, but behold some part of it not once attempted, <hi>That the Tenth is God's part,</hi> was proved by Scripture, Reason, and the Authority of St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> pag. <hi>21, 22.</hi> but how many of these he leaves untouched the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may see in his <hi>15</hi> and <hi>16</hi> Pages: <hi>The
<pb facs="tcp:200297:21"/> Instance of</hi> Judah<hi>'s acting agreeably to God's Will,</hi> without a Precedent Law on Record, and that Act afterward ratified by a written Law as Tithes were, <hi>pag. 28.</hi> he wholly passes by. What is said in my <hi>44</hi> and <hi>45</hi> Pages, touching the manner of God's settling Tithes on the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> and what was Ceremonial in that set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, this in his <hi>63</hi> Page he calls repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my former groundless Supposition, and so quits his hands of it. The first also of those Lessons which, <hi>pag. 46.</hi> I say we learn from the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law, he so craftily conceals, <hi>pag. 65.</hi> that the Quakers (who read no more of my Book than he shews them) may think that he answered them all. The Proofs which are brought in my <hi>72</hi> Page, that voluntary Dedication gives God a new Title to the Tenth part, and is of such force as to make a thing God's that was not his before; this he takes no notice of in his <hi>150</hi> Page, but entertains his Reader with little frivolous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils: Two very plain Proofs out of St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi> of Tithes paid in his time, in my <hi>81,</hi> and <hi>82</hi> Pages he saith nothing against. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother very full proof of endowed Churches from the Council of <hi>Gangra</hi> at large, <hi>p. 86.</hi> he makes no Reply to, but only by saying Tithes are not mentioned by name. My <hi>96, 97,</hi> and <hi>98</hi> Pages, which shew the Ʋniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal and free explicit consent of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Ethelwolfe</hi>'s time, and of all Ages after, which is the main thing to prove the
<pb facs="tcp:200297:22"/>
               <hi>Voluntary Donation</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> he makes no direct answer to, but in his <hi>211,</hi> and <hi>212</hi> Pages Quibbles on the words <hi>[Grant and Comfirmation]</hi> and pretends we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of the time when Tithes were settled, when in Truth, we are disputing of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how they were settled, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Donation,</hi> which Post he is so far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving that he never sets his mighty shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to it. My Instances, <hi>pag. 104.</hi> which prove that the faults of those to whom the <hi>Donation</hi> is made, do not invalidate the <hi>Donation</hi> it self, which fully answer all his pretences of the corruption of <hi>Ethelwolf</hi>'s Clergy (were they as true as they are false.) To these he answereth and saith nothing. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, my definition of a Freehold, <hi>pag. 184.</hi> shewed to agree to Tithes. My instances of the French Protestants paying Tithes to the Popish Clergy, and the Royalists to the men of the late times, <hi>p. 228.</hi> My examples of Primitive Emperours inflicting Penalties on Hereticks, <hi>pag. 237.</hi> with many more Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Instances, Proofs and Authorities, are left untouched; and yet this vain man brags at every turn, <hi>Thus have I shewed,</hi> p. <hi>57. Thus have I made it evident: Thus far my way is cleared, and nothing left unremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> pag. <hi>96.</hi> when indeed he removes nothing of that which he dares mention, but removes many things indeed out of sight by a base and cowardly suppression of them. And when he hath stript my Position of its proofs, and
<pb facs="tcp:200297:22"/> not at all produced or answered them in their proper place (as for example that about the Tenth being Gods part in his <hi>15</hi> and 16th Pages) He quotes that Position naked (as he hath made it to his own shame) <hi>pag. 80.</hi> and being got (he thinks) far enough from discovery of his omission, wretchedly insults as if <hi>I shewed this only by saying so, and begged the Question;</hi> and <hi>pag. 81.</hi> he tells his Quakers that I say, <hi>We may believe it, we must believe it, we ought to believe it:</hi> As if I said nothing else, and did not give good reasons of the truth of that which I there affirmed ought to be believed. What base and vile shifts, what poor and unworthy Arts are these? Who can Interpret them otherwaies than the signs of a sinking Cause, and marks of a baffled Adversary, who was to say something that might by the credulous and easie, be taken for an Answer? <hi>Non enim ad omnes sed ad suos loquitur.</hi> Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. <hi>de</hi> Ruffin. <hi>Tom. 2. p. 310.</hi>

            <p n="7">§. 7. THus have you seen <hi>T. E.</hi> in his own colours, and beheld the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription he hath given us of himself in this very Book; and truly, I think, the World will be satisfied by these evidences, that he hath not Humility, Patience, and Charity enough to make him a Christian, nor Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sufficient to make him a Scollar, nor Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity enough to render him a fair Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb facs="tcp:200297:23"/> nor indeed Integrity sufficient to denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate him an honest man.</p>
            <p>I have not willingly taken any advantage against him, but proved this by his own words and deeds, so that if we consider such a Book writ by such a man, this very Introduction is all the Answer it deserves or needs. Nor had I meddled with it any further, if the Book had contained nothing but what was his own: But for the sake of those Authors he abuses, and in pity to that sort of men whom he gulls with great Names, I will shew that he hath either mistaken his Authors, or else they themselves were evidently mistaken, and since I can both enlarge and confirm my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Arguments and Proofs, and give further evidence and strength to the <hi>Right of Tithes,</hi> I will clear and fortifie the Question as I go along through every Period, as not thinking it worth either my own or the Readers pains or time meerly to be entertained with <hi>T. E</hi>'s folly or falshood. 'Tis true, his Quakers and some of their pitch, have admired this Book as much, if not more, than they did the other. But <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Maxim shews how little I need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that, <hi>'Tis certain</hi> (saith he) <hi>that man hath made the worst Speech, which they cry up the most,</hi> l. <hi>2.</hi> Ep. <hi>14.</hi> It is the Censure of wise and good men (the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fit Judges of these matters) which ought to be considered, and they do all discern the ignorance and ill dealing of my Adversary at first sight, and since they condemn him, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
<pb facs="tcp:200297:23"/> him not the applause of his undiscerning Circle, <hi>who are not to be pleased</hi> (saith <hi>Plutarch) without displeasing the wiser sort of men.</hi> De lib. educ. 'Tis the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous part of the World whose approbation I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire. I would rescue the rest from their mistakes, if Arguments and fair Proofs will do it; if not, I need wish them no greater nor other requital than that they may mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest their own abilities by admiring <hi>T. E.</hi> still. I cannot think it at all strange that a man of his confidence and obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy should make a Second Reply, for he hath a Fore-head to deny the plainest Truth, and a face to affirm the most ridiculous or most evident untruth, he hath pride enough to incite him to it, and dishonesty good store to assist him in it, as he Answered my First Book, so may he Answer this or any other Book in the World, as long as he can Cavil, and shuffle, and Rail, he may pretend he hath Answered me, and some will be so vain as to believe him, but whatever seeming rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son he hath brought (and doubtless we see all his store) I shall sufficiently disprove now, and then for his Sophistry and Railing, I may safely despise them, the one being not able to hurt my Cause, nor the other my Reputation, for as the Philosopher once said, when he was told, an ill man reviled him, <hi>Let him go on</hi> (saith he) <hi>for none that knows us both, will either believe him when he speaks ill of me, or me when I speak well
<pb facs="tcp:200297:24"/> of him.</hi> And if the World will but pardon me for publishing this Answer against such an Adversary, I will promise, that till he get more Learning, and use more Honesty, I will never give it nor my self the trouble of any further Reply; and I perswade my self, if ever <hi>T. E.</hi> come to be endued with these two Qualifications, he will save me that labour by recanting his errors, and confessing his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, which being so necessary to his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don both from God and Man, I do, for his own sake, heartily wish, and for theirs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so whom he hath hardened in their delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

E.</hi> makes no scruple to Droll upon a Sentence of the Gospel, to open the way for a silly Jest of his own, as if I had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the Parishoner (in the Friendly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference) that <hi>Swine</hi> before whom my Friend was loth to cast his <hi>Pearls,</hi> but he forgets it was (before Swine) in the plural Number, that is, before (not that single man, but) the whole Herd of Quakers, those Creatures which tread all the Pearls of Reason and Scripture alledged against their wild opinions under their feet, a Drove that are all Cry and no Wool; it was before these, I thought my Friend was loth to throw that sort of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and therefore not my Friend, but <hi>T. E.</hi> and his Brother-Speakers, will prove the Swine-herds by this comparison.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 12, 13. After my Adversary had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed that the Author of the Friendly Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, <hi>Durst not venture his Cause upon the Divine Right,</hi> 1 Book p. 277. and said that, <hi>He dares not undertake at all to prove the Divine Right of Tithes,</hi> ibid. p. 283. yet he falls briskly upon disproving the Divine Right for six or seven <hi>pages,</hi> and draws up a formal conclusion against it, <hi>ibid. p.</hi> 283. Now this I justly blamed him for, and rightly called it a skulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trick, to fall upon a Question, which that Gentleman declared (and the Quaker con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed) was set by on purpose; And surely it is a vain boast to come in bragging, that he needs not stick to say he hath disproved that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:200297:28"/> which himself grants, my Friend never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertoook at all to prove in that Discourse. That he did not undertake to prove the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right in the Friendly Conference is true, but it is one of <hi>T. E</hi>'s boasting falshoods, that he durst not undertake it, for who can think (but a bold and ignorant man) that it is a daring thing, to justifie a principle, which the most and best learned in all Ages have held against a few modern Schoolmen and Fryers, and their up-start followers the illiterate Quakers; was this such a terrible underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king? surely no. But the bolder attempt was for <hi>T. E.</hi> to undertake to disprove it against all those great Names mentioned in my 16 and 17 pages, which he knowing not how to ballance, cunningly removed to page 25. and durst not let his Quakers see in the proper place who it was they opposed in this their Opinion.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. PAge 13. Many of his petty Fallacies and slighter Cavils I omit, that I may the more directly pass to the Question, about the stating whereof he wrangles throughout this whole Section. Now since <hi>T. E.</hi> confesses that my Friend, <hi>Ʋndertakes not at all to prove the Divine Right,</hi> pag. 283. It is not to be expected that he should at all meddle with stating that Question in the Friendly Conference; and surely since I do undertake to prove it, I may take the Liberty to state this Question of the <hi>Divine Right:</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:200297:28"/> my Friend was proving Tithes were not pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ceremonial (as the Quakers would have them) and occasionally said that those <hi>Who insist upon the Divine Right of Tithes, derive them not from</hi> Levi <hi>but</hi> Melchisedec: <hi>Friendly Conf. pag.</hi> 135. but he did not say as <hi>T. E.</hi> falsly cites him (2 Book <hi>pag.</hi> 14.) that the Divine Right of Tithes was derived from <hi>Melchisedec:</hi> for it is properly the Payment and not the Right which we derive from <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedec,</hi> that is, as I noted before, the Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Divine Right, do make the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Right to be in God, as my Friend al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so observes <hi>pag.</hi> 134. But the first upon record to whom they were actually paid, was <hi>Melchisedec</hi> the Priest of the most High God, long before <hi>Levi;</hi> and since the Divine Right was first recognized in that payment made to <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> we derive them (saith my Friend) <hi>i. e.</hi> the payment of them, not from <hi>Levi</hi> but <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> which shews he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the Question very well, though he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not to stand upon it there: And makes it appear that <hi>T. E.</hi> wilfully or ignorantly blundered it by discoursing as if the Original Right were in <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> and as if we had claimed Tithes now as being originally due to <hi>Melchisedec:</hi> But since I have stated the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, now, <hi>T.E.</hi> (that undertakes to answer me) must either prove I stated it wrong, which he doth not once attempt, or confess I stated it right, and then he yields me that point. And whereas he frivolously urges that, <hi>To whom Tithes were originally due, was
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:200297:29"/> not the Question,</hi> pag. 15. I answer that my Friend did not directly and designedly debate this or any other Question relating to the Divine Right in his first Book, although he doth clearly enough speak of Tithes as a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to God, and his share of our substance, <hi>pag.</hi> 134. and afterwards also of <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> receiving them as a Priest, <hi>pag.</hi> 135. but it is not to be imagined he should formally and accurately distinguish the original Right, from the recognition of that Right, in a passage meerly occasional; but <hi>T. E.</hi> (when he sets himself to disprove the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi>) may not be allowed to blunder these two, which are the main Enquirys to those who would fairly dispute of the Divine Right of Tithes, from the particulars of this first period before the Law. And if any will please to compare his first Book from <hi>pag.</hi> 277. to <hi>pag.</hi> 281. with my former Discourse, <hi>pag.</hi> 21, 22, 23. I shall freely leave it to them to judge which of us best understood or stated the Question. For the present I am content to give this brief Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my proceeding: 1. That God hath a Right in general to all our Goods, <hi>Psal.</hi> xxiv. 1. 2. That he hath a more special Right to some part of them, which are or ought to be given to him back again in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of his bounty, and as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognition of his general right to all the rest, <hi>Prov.</hi> iii. 9. 3. That this part to which God hath a special right, cannot be more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly paid unto him, than by giving it for the maintaining of his Worship, and what is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:200297:29"/> so given is given unto himself, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxix. 14. Now these things being plain from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reason and Scripture, there are two things besides to be enquired after more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to prove the main Question. 1. <hi>What part that is which God would have</hi> us <hi>give him by way of acknowledgement of his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Right.</hi> 2. <hi>Who must be Gods receiver of this part.</hi> And of both these particulars, this period before the Law affords us clear proofs, for its manifest from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s giving and <hi>Jacob</hi>'s vowing the Tenth part, and God's recording both with Approbation, as also from the Testimonies of St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that the Tenth is God's part: And by <hi>Melchisedec</hi>'s being a Priest, and receiving them as such; as also by the Heathen usage of bringing to the Priests that which was due to God, and <hi>Origen</hi>'s Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which we shewed in the former Book, that the Priests were to be his Receivers: Thus far we have gone towards proving the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right of Tithes, which (because it is not our intent to Cavil about phrases▪ but to Dispute plainly) we have now laid down in other words to the former sense, and shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our Discourse to vindicate these two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, and our proofs of them from the Quakers shuffling exceptions, when we have remembred <hi>T. E.</hi> that Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> (an Author who ought to weigh with him very much) as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts both these Propositions, saying, <hi>The Tenth is the Lords; And by him it is assigned to his Faithful Ministers. Synops. papismi p.</hi> 312.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:200297:30"/>§. 3. PAg. 15. If the Quaker either had a good Cause to manage, or were a Man that feared to do unjustly, we should not find him so often shuffling and dealing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully, such Tricks being the certain indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of an ill man, and a bad Cause: My first Position he gives in words of his own framing thus, <hi>The Tenth belongs to God,</hi> and to this he replies, <hi>That all belongs to God,</hi> cite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Psal.</hi> xxiv. 1. Which is no other than what I affirmed <hi>pag.</hi> 21. only he knows we are not disputing about God's general Right to all (of which that Verse in the <hi>Psalm</hi> speaks) but of a special right to some part of our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to be given in acknowledgment for his bounty in bestowing the rest upon us; and therefore it is fallaciously done (and very like himself) to confound these two, meerly to delude his Reader. And whereas he saith I mis-apply <hi>Prov.</hi> iii. 9. and pretends I restrain it to the payment of Tithes, he speaks falsly; for I do not so much as bring in that place to prove the payment of a Tenth part, but to prove that principle of natural reason, <hi>"That we ought to give God some part of his gifts back again as a token of our gratitude:</hi> Which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law I affirm is set down in Scripture, <hi>Prov.</hi> iii. 9. <hi>Honour the Lord with thy Substance;</hi> and this Rule of giving some part, I there say, obliges Christians as well as Jews: As for what part or proportion this must be, I do not enquire till afterwards; so that <hi>T. E.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:200297:30"/> sets down this Proposition too soon, and when I am proving one thing, he makes his Quakers believe I am proving another, which is meer collusion. But that this place <hi>Prov.</hi> iii. 9. doth prove the thing I brought it to prove, <hi>viz. That we ought to give God some part of his Gifts back again,</hi> &amp;c. is manifest from the Scripture sense of the word <hi>Honour,</hi> which signifies to give some part, especially to our Superiours, to those whom we Honour; and indeed such gifts to our Betters are Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary presents, and tokens of the true respect we bear towards them; thus our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Expounds the V. Commandment, <hi>Honour thy Father and Mother,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> xv. 4, 5, 6. <hi>viz.</hi> as implying we should give them some part of our Estate<note n="(a)" place="margin">Honor, Donum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligitur: Hierom. in <hi>Matth. xv.</hi>
               </note>, and so Interpreters Expound the words in many other places<note n="(b)" place="margin">Numb. xxii. 17, 18. Ac. xxviii. 10. 1 Tim. v. 17.</note>. And indeed this place Expounds it self; for to clear it, that the meaning of <hi>Honouring God with our Substance,</hi> is, by giving some part of it unto him, it follows—<hi>And with the First-Fruits of all thine Increase:</hi> Now how can we Honour God with First-Fruits, but by giving them to his Honour? The Quaker therefore is he that mis-applies this place, when he interprets it, <hi>Of using the Goods of this World in Gods holy fear, and to his Glory;</hi> since <hi>Solomon</hi> is not speaking of what man uses, but what is to be given to God for his part; and the Promise that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the next Verse, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. <hi>So shall thy Barns be filled with plenty,</hi> &amp;c. is so like to that of <hi>Malach.</hi> iii. 10. of the plenty which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:200297:31"/> God will give to them that pay their Tithes, that it made many Ancient Fathers and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils apply this very Text of <hi>Proverbs</hi> to the matter of Tithes, though I did not urge it so far in this place; but only for some part. And <hi>T. E.</hi> grants that God might reserve some share to himself, but is not <hi>satisfied</hi> that he did, because he finds no such appropriation of a Tenth part in Scripture, excepting only in the time of the <hi>Levitical Law,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he calls for a positive Precept of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, either before that Law, or since the Dissolution thereof, this is the sense of his 16 and 17 <hi>pages:</hi> To which I reply, That 'tis hard to <hi>satisfie</hi> a man resolved before not to believe any thing contrary to the Position he undertakes to maintain, but others are <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> that God did reserve some share to himself, and that the Tenth is that share. <hi>The Lord of all</hi> (saith an Ancient Author) <hi>not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained some persons to Minister to himself, as the Ministers of the Church; but also some things as Tithes for the Sustenance of his Ministers; and some part of Time, as the Daies for solemn Religion,</hi> Hug. de S. Victor. reg. 5. And as for Scripture, if there be no positive Precept before the Law (no more than there is for putting an Adulteress to Death) yet there are positive Examples before the Law, which being the practices of men inspired and guided by Revelation in all their solemn Acts, those Examples of such persons are as plain indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Gods pleasure, as Precepts are. They that God directed, gave a Tenth part,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:200297:31"/> and that is recorded; nor is there any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any other proportion given in this manner before the Law. Therefore the Tenth was that part which God would have them so to give: And 'tis very strange that Quakers should allow nothing to be done agreeable to God's Will without a positive Command in Scripture, since they profess, <hi>To have things revealed to them from the Lord, which are not to be found in the Scriptures particularly, not so much as by consequence,</hi> G. <hi>Keith.</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Revel. p. 5, 6. And if a poor Quaker have this priviledge now, will he deny it to so great and so certainly inspired Patriarchs then, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacob?</hi> Now if it were revealed to them from the Lord, that the Tenth was that part, then it was God's Will they should give that part, and God cannot be supposed to choose and direct that part which he hath no Right unto. To be sure any sufficient indication of God's Will to have that part given before the Law, will prove God's Right to that part before the Law, and we think that the recorded Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of two inspired Patriarchs fixing upon the Tenth part, sufficiently shew, that was the part God would have, since we cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great absurdity suppose they acted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to God's Will in so solemn Acts as these were; and if they acted agreeable to his Will, then these Acts declare God's Right to a Tenth part before the Law; and if we would give such a part as God will be pleased with, we must follow their Example and give
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:200297:32"/> the same part they gave: By this it appears how falsly <hi>T. E.</hi> speaks of me, when he says, <hi>pag.</hi> 17. That <hi>I take it for granted, the men of</hi> Abrahams <hi>age knew by the Light of Nature, that the Tenth part belonged to God.</hi> Whereas I only said, the Light of Nature teaches that some part was due, see my 21 <hi>pag.</hi> and <hi>pag.</hi> 24. But that the Tenth was that part, I alwaies make to depend upon Revelation. And again, he wilfully prevaricates in pretending God had left the Maintenance of his Gospel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters to the doubtful construction of a single Act of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s, or a Vow of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s: for though that was all which was recorded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Gospel Maintenance then, and was enough to be said of it so many hundred years before Christ came, yet we have many more proofs of it now, besides what was set down in that period, <hi>viz.</hi> The Lords fixing the same part under the Law, and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our not repealing that part, as also several Texts of the New Testament expounded by primitive opinion and practice; all which put together do sufficiently prove God's Right to the Tenth part; but of these in their proper periods.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 18. Instead of replying to what I brought in my 22 <hi>page</hi> to prove <hi>the Tenth to be God's due,</hi> the Quaker skips into my 30, 31, 33, and 34 <hi>pages,</hi> to glean up some Sentences relating to another matter, and wickedly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies them to this position; for I am there speaking of the frequency of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tithe, and of the particular manner how
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:200297:32"/> he came to know the Tenth to be God's part, whether by a Revelation to himself, or by a Tradition grounded upon some Revelation to a former Patriarch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now I thought it enough to render it <hi>probable</hi> he paid Tithes often, and paid the Tenth part either by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation immediate or by such a Tradition, and having proved before by certain Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>That the Tenth was God's part,</hi> I thought it not necessary to be absolute and positive in these less material Questions. Now my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Adversary takes what I spoke of those things which were only to be <hi>made probable,</hi> and applies them to this Main Question which I proved by positive Arguments and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and then <hi>pag.</hi> 19. he foolishly thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults, <hi>He argues from</hi> may be <hi>to</hi> must be, <hi>and from</hi> must be <hi>to</hi> may be <hi>back again:</hi> Whereas concerning the Tenth being God's part (which is the present Question) I argue by plain and positive proofs, as will appear by the little evidence he brings against them: for having argued <hi>First</hi> from the Example of two inspired Patriarchs, I prove it <hi>Secondly</hi> from <hi>Levit.</hi> xxvii. 30. where before there had been any positive Law for paying Tithes, God declared his right to them, saying, <hi>All the Tithe of the Land is the Lords:</hi> I am sure <hi>T. E.</hi> in his 192 page, will not allow such a Proposition, to be a Constitution by precept; and if so, then this is a declaration of God's Right to the Tenth part long before any writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Law about the assignation of them to <hi>Levi.</hi> Roberts, <hi>Reven. of Gosp. pag.</hi> 11. (out
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:200297:33"/> of <hi>Perkins</hi> his Digest) proves, that this claim in <hi>Levit.</hi> was in the second year after they came out of <hi>Egypt, Levit.</hi> xxvii. 34. but the assignation to the <hi>Levites, Numb.</hi> xviii. 21. was not till about the thirtieth year, <hi>i. e.</hi> not till twenty eight years after this claim; And therefore God asserted his Right to the Tenth part long before the assignation of it to the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priest-hood, and the Tenth was his Right and Due before the Law: And some think these words <hi>[—is the Lords]</hi> do refer to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Example, and <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Vow, that is, you may learn sufficiently from those Acts of your inspired Predecessors, that this part is mine, that this is the part you ought to give me, I taught them to give it, and <hi>Jacob</hi> your Father by my direction vowed he would give me Tithe of all I should give him (in which Vow some include what God gave his posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty). Therefore though you may either use the other parts your selves, or make any of those parts mine by special Vow, creating a new Right by such a Vow (of which all the former part of this xxvii Chapter of <hi>Levit.</hi> Discourseth) yet <hi>All the Tithe is mine already, and you cannot create me any new Right to that by a special Vow:</hi> Let any man Read and unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicedly consider the place, and he cannot deny this to be the plain sense of it.</p>
            <p>My Third Argument is <hi>Exod.</hi> xxii. 29. which is the first time they are mentioned in the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Latine (a Translation quoted with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation by <hi>T.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:200297:33"/> reddere, Thou shalt not delay to offer thy Tithes and First-Fruits;</hi> and the Hebrew word there used, signifies <hi>Tithes,</hi> as much as <hi>First ripe Fruits,</hi> for literally it is in the Hebrew, <hi>Thy fullness,</hi> or <hi>Thy abundance,</hi> i. e. that which is more than God allows thee for thy own use, which may as justly be applyed (as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> doth) to Tithes, as to First-Fruits, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed comprehends both: and since the oldest Latin Version, and the Fathers understand this place of Tithes, to which the Original also well enough agrees, we conclude that God here also supposes a Tenth part due to him, and bids them not delay to give it to him, and this was before the Tabernacle was reared, or the <hi>Levites</hi> chosen, so that even without respect to the <hi>Levites,</hi> God's own Right is declared. And <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To shew that the assignation of them afterward to <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi</hi> had no waies taken off from God's Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Right, I noted (in my 22 <hi>page</hi>) that <hi>Malach.</hi> iii. 8. those who paid not this Due, are said (not to Rob the Priests, but) <hi>To Rob God:</hi> And <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I added the Authorities of St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> and St. <hi>Austin</hi> for the Christians, and of <hi>Plutarch</hi> for the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that <hi>The Tenth was God's special Right:</hi> To all which <hi>T.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:200297:35"/> Christians being of the same opinion: All which <hi>T.

Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing;</hi> the other his receiving the Reward of a Priest, <hi>viz. Receiving Tithes,</hi> Heb. vii. Now if the receiving God's Tenth part were not appropriate to the Priest-hood, how could the Apostle prove from <hi>Melchisedec</hi>'s receiving Tithes, that he was a Priest? If there be any force in that Argument of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, it must relie on this principle, That the being God's Receiver of his Tenth part, is annexed insepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably to the Priest-hood: However therefore our Quaker be so bold to deny this to be a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple or dictate of right Reason, yet Authors of the highest note think otherwise, and our own Masters of Law are of my Opinion, for my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> upon those words in <hi>Magna Charta <hi>[Concessimus Deo]</hi>

Thus far then we have clear proofs, that the Tenth is God's pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Right, and that his Priests are to be his Receivers: now as to the manner how <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> came to know this, I conceive it is not necessary for us to be positive and particular, further than to prove that he was taught it by God: And either he or some of the▪ pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Patriarchs fixed upon this Tenth part meerly by their own fancy, or else they were directed to fix upon it by Revelation: now that the Tenth part was not chosen by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man fancy, is evident, in that God himself did make the same choice under the Law, and it is a great disparagement to the Divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to follow the weak and shallow guidance of human Invention; It is not likely, That the Majesty of God would have fixed this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, unless it had first proceeded from himself. Nor is it imaginable how this part
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:200297:36"/> should be so generally fixed on among all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, unless it had sprung from a Divine Original; Human Fancy being various and uncertain, so that if it had begun from thence, some Nations and Persons would have had one part, some another, <hi>For how could Man know</hi> (saith an Ancient Author) <hi>that he must give the Tenth rather than the Ninth, the Eighth, or any other part of his Goods, if he had not been taught it at first by God?</hi> Hug. de S.

And withal I would advise <hi>T.

And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> doubts of their doing this yearly, because he finds Vows are oft mentioned in these consecrations; let it be noted, Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> well knew, that many of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> Vows were concerning things necessary, and many of them yearly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly renewed, as that Vow for the safety of the Emperour, which <hi>Pliny</hi> the Second wishes, he may every year pay, and every year consign a new. <hi>Tertullian</hi> also speaking of these Vows notes, <hi>They were annually renewed:</hi> And Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> himself proves, the Vows of paying Tithes were made yearly, by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription thus Expounded by the Noble <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Omnibus hic annis, votorum more suorum, &amp;c.</hi> see <hi>Selden</hi> Hist. pag. 28. and (were it not to avoid prolixity) I could by many more Instances prove that all (who were accounted pious) did yearly and upon all occasions of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:200297:42"/> extraordinary Gain besides, pay Tithes of all sort of things to one Deity or other: nor is it easie to tell how so many thousand Deities as the <hi>Romans</hi> had, with their Temples and Priests, could be maintained otherwise. And that they did not give these Tithes arbitrarily, when they pleased, and if they pleased; 'tis plain even out of Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> That <hi>it was a Custom so to do,</hi> Didymus <hi>ut supr. &amp;</hi> Cassius <hi>pag.</hi> 32. <hi>agreeable to the ancient usage.</hi> L.

To which may be added the general opinion amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they who paid Tithes would be Rich and Blessed in their Estates, and they who neglected it, accursed and poor. And this suffices to shew how falsly Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> corrects <hi>Paulus,</hi> and how ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the opinion and practice of the Tenth part being God's due, had spread it self in the Heathen World. As to <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Selden,</hi> I have reason enough to say, <hi>Quantum juris</hi> Aristarchi <hi>isti sibi sumpserunt in antiquis Authoribus corrigendis?</hi> And I hope the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will think no worse of honest <hi>Paulus,</hi> for these mens censures, since <hi>Scaliger</hi> is well known to have censured many better Scholars than himself. And of <hi>Erasmus</hi> he saith in particular, that he was <hi>Totius Naturae ignarus;</hi> yea and Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> imitates him pretty near, calling all that dissent from him by the scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest

            <p>The rest of the Objections which he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows to oppose this Universal custom are very frivolous. <hi>First,</hi> He tells us out of <hi>Selden, Cato</hi> is silent concerning it, which signifies very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle when so many other Authors of as great credit do mention it; <hi>viz.

Could the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens learn from the Jews to act contrary to them? To Vow Arbitrarily, sometimes and in an uncertain quantity, could this be learned from them who (as <hi>T.

Either therefore let him confess the Heathens paid Tithes constantly, generally, and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the Jews did, os else revoke his foolish
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:200297:43"/> and contradicting Assertion of their learning it from the Jews. But he tells us fallaciously, <hi>so it seemed to</hi> Selden; how? Did it seem to <hi>Selden</hi> that the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> (of whom our principal enquiry here is) learned to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate Tithes from the Jews? No such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: only he thought the <hi>Arabians,</hi> their Neighbours, might learn it from the Jews, for he thinks the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had it from the <hi>Phoenicians (Melchisedec</hi>'s Neighbours, if not Subjects) and <hi>Selden</hi> adds there (which the cunning Quaker suppresses) <hi>Neither is it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely that the ancient and most known Example of</hi> Abraham <hi>gave the first ground, both to them (i. e.</hi> the <hi>Phoenicians) and the Europeans</hi> (i. e. to the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans) so sometimes to dispose of their Spoils of War to Holy uses,</hi> Selden, <hi>pag.</hi> 34. He therefore, though he curtail the account, with his [sometimes, and Spoils of War] to make it sute his own design, yet he confesses contrary to <hi>T.

            <p>Some petty Cavils against this and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s ordinarily or frequent paying (of which we shall treat §. 11.) <hi>T. E.</hi> here makes, to which a brief Reply may suffice: And <hi>First,</hi> he mistakes to think I draw a general rule from this particular and extraordinary case, for then (as the Quaker Expounds the place) I must have inferred, <hi>That all Souldiers ought from this Example of</hi> Abraham, <hi>alwaies to give Tithes of their Spoils:</hi> but this I never did affirm, nor do I draw any rule at all from this particular case, nor from any thing extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary in it: I do bring this Case with many others in conjunction, and from them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I infer, <hi>That the Tenth is God's part, and the Priest his Receiver;</hi> and in this Case if the Victory and Spoils were extraordinary, yet a Priest blessing, and a faithful man acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging God's bounty by oblation of a Tenth part, this is ordinary; this was found in this Case among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> under <hi>Moses</hi> Law, and in Gospel times also, and it is only from what is ordinary in this instance of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that I draw my proofs, and so do not offend against my Friends rule in any wise. Again, <hi>T. E.</hi> (who is alwaies most confident when he hath least ground to be so) quarrels at my mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty (in his 37 <hi>page</hi>) in that I assert only the probability of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s giving Tithes in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. But the Reader my observe, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because it is not necessary to the main Question to determine absolutely that he Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily gave Tithes, or paid them: for if he did it but once, since then it was the Tenth
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:200297:46"/> and no other part, and was presented to a Priest, and no other person; that shews a Divinely inspired Patriarch thought <hi>The Tenth to be the properest part, and a Priest the fittest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver.</hi> And if by great distance, or other unavoidable difficulties, <hi>Abraham</hi> had paid but once, yet the omission of practice, upon just occasion, doth no way over-throw the force of a Divine Institution, as appears from the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> paying no <hi>Tithes</hi> in the Wilderness, from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s asserting his right, even when he did not receive his dues, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. &amp;c. yet I did make it very probable, that he gave Tithes Ordinarily, shewing it by many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which I shall confirm, §. 11. And if the Reader please to read that place, with the 31, 32, and 33 <hi>pages</hi> of my former Book, he will see I had other grounds for that Assertion besides Scriptures silence; and yet as to that silence, whatever <hi>T. E.</hi> can say against <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s giving Tithes more than once, from this ground, <hi>Because the Scripture mentions his Titheing but once,</hi> I might (would I be as ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous as he) urge to prove <hi>Melchisedec</hi> never blessed God but once, because the Scripture never mentions his blessing God but once. But if it be probable <hi>Melchisedec</hi> blessed God oftner than once, notwithstanding it be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned but once, why is it not as probable <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> gave Tithes more than once, though it be mentioned only once? I brought probable reasons to prove he gave them oftner, and <hi>T. E.</hi> denies it only because he doth not read it in Scripture, and therefore it is no Soloecism

E.</hi> to be so confident of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture silence in this Matter, for the Text in <hi>Genesis</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> being indefinite and without any limitation, <hi>He gave Tithes of all;</hi> it cannot be inferred thence that he did it but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly once: and since the words are true, if <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> gave him Tithes of all, yearly and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, there is no stress to be laid upon such a limitation (only once, or the like) as <hi>T. E.</hi> imposes upon the Text; some there are who do Interpret <hi>[He gave]</hi> thus, <hi>He did by Promise and Consecration give the Tithe of all to him; and afterward made it good by payments so frequent and so publick, that the</hi> Gentiles <hi>learned this practice from him.</hi> And even in <hi>Genesis</hi> it self, the word <hi>[Give]</hi> is put for <hi>[promising to Give]</hi> as where 'tis said concerning <hi>Isaac, Ʋnto him hath He</hi> [that is, <hi>Abraham] given all that he hath, Gen.</hi> xxiv. 36. that is, <hi>Abraham</hi> had by Promise declared he would give <hi>Isaac</hi> all that he had, though as yet he had not actually turned himself out of possession; and <hi>Rab. Salomon</hi> saith, <hi>Abraham</hi> did this by a Deed in Writing delivered to his Steward, to be shewed to the Friends of his Sons Wife; and so he doth explain that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Eliezer, vers.</hi> 10. all the Goods of his Master were <hi>in his hand,</hi> that is (saith
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:200297:47"/> he) a Deed in Writing containing this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Gift: yea in common speech we say, <hi>We give,</hi> when we Vow to give; so that the words may fairly be expounded of Giving, so as to infer an ordinary payment, and then <hi>T. E</hi>'s negative arguing falls to the Ground, with all the Chimaera's he built upon it. And for his Dilemma it returns upon himself, for the Spirit hath recorded, <hi>Abraham</hi> gave Tithes of all to a Priest, therefore that hath relation to future Ages; and hath spoken in words which doth not deny ordinary payment, and therefore <hi>T. E.</hi> cannot from them infer <hi>He did not pay ordinarily,</hi> and that negation had no relation to future times, and therefore was not recorded. So also for that Maxim, he abuses <hi>Expressa nocent, &amp;c.</hi> The plain sense of it applied to this Case is this: It is exprest that he gave Tithes of all, and to a Priest, which makes for my Assertion; But it is not exprest that he gave Tithes only once: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that cannot be pretended against my As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion. But I hasten to that which is more material, and leave <hi>T.

               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:200297:48"/>§. 10. PAg. 41, 42, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He should regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly now have gone on to confute my Arguments which prove, that <hi>Abraham</hi> did ordinarily Give Tithes, but these <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be</hi>'s, are too hard for his Teeth yet, and therefore he leaves them and skips from my 31 <hi>page</hi> to my 35 <hi>page,</hi> to enquire, <hi>What Right</hi> Melchisedec <hi>had to these Tithes?</hi> He thinks he had none <hi>Founded upon Natural Justice and Equity;</hi> because in those daies there was no setled publick Worship wherein he could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any Outward Priestly Office or Service. Two impertinent words it seems, <hi>viz. [Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> and <hi>Service]</hi> I left out in my citing this Sentence, and though it be Non-sense while they stand in the Sentence, I am highly charged for going about to make the Quaker speak sense: But I would know who ever heard of an Inward Priestly Office or Service? A Priest is for Publick Worship, and therefore his Office and Service must be outward, and <hi>Melchisedec</hi> openly and audibly and outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did bless God, and so do all other that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be Priests, except the <hi>Mumbling Mass-Priests, and Quaking Leaders at dumb Meetings:</hi> such inward Service, I confess, cannot have any right to be rewarded; but such out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Service as <hi>Melchisedec</hi> and Gospel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters perform, may justly be requited by Tithes. If inward Service had been enough, then every private man might have done that in his own breast; there had been no need of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:200297:48"/> a Priestly Office but for outward Service, which Office he executing outwardly, and openly before a great Congregation, he had a right to Tithes founded upon natural Justice and Equity. And if <hi>T. E.</hi> pretend he reads only of his doing this once, yet however, for that once (then) <hi>Melchisedee</hi> had a right to receive Tithes once, and consequently They that bless God openly, and outwardly, and execute their Priestly Office constantly (as Gospel Ministers do) These have a right to receive Tithes alwaies. But what reason hath <hi>T. E.</hi> to be so positive that <hi>There was no setled Publick Worship then?</hi> He tells us <hi>pag.</hi> 41. that Learned Men have been of various Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about that Text, <hi>Gen.</hi> iv. 26. <hi>Then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan men to call upon the Name of the Lord.</hi> But are not learned men also of various Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about that Text, <hi>Heb.</hi> vii. 4? yet <hi>T. E.</hi> is positive enough there for his own sense <hi>[Spoils]: God saith Spoils</hi> (that is, he means, in our Translation) and might not I say here, God saith <hi>they began to call upon his Name,</hi> for so we Translate it, and how darest thou, O Quaker, say—<hi>began to prophane it?</hi> If <hi>Hierom</hi> reads here <hi>Iste coepit. Hierom</hi> also reads, <hi>Heb.</hi> vii. 4. (not Tithe of Spoils, but) <hi>Tithe of the chiefest.</hi> If <hi>T. E.</hi> will allow <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> in one place, I will allow him in the other; for if <hi>Enos</hi> began to call upon Gods Name, surely he was not the first who did it private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, unless all were Atheists that went before. So that St. <hi>Hierom</hi> (as I can prove from his other works) did not believe there was no
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:200297:49"/> Publick Worship then; and Page 9. shews he counted it a better Version, to Translate it <hi>began to call upon the Name of the Lord,</hi> than— <hi>began to pollute,</hi> and therefore he puts the first in the Text, the other but in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and in the second place there. <hi>But</hi> (saith <hi>T. E.</hi>) Tremelius <hi>and</hi> Junius <hi>read it downright</hi> prophane, <hi>Tunc coeptum est propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nari in invocando nomine Domini.</hi> Which is no other but a mistaken and rejected Version, for the last and best Editions of <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremelius</hi> read, <hi>Tunc coeptum est invocari nomen Jehovae;</hi> and if <hi>Genebrad</hi> and <hi>Broughton</hi> assent to their best reading, then all <hi>T. E</hi>'s Witnesses are on my side: However I am sure of <hi>Junius</hi> his Opinion, who not only Translates it, <hi>Then the Name of Jehova began to be called upon,</hi> but he hath a long Marginal Note to confute those who Translate it <hi>Prophane,</hi> and to shew <hi>That the Sons of God then gathered themselves into the body of a Church, and used Preaching, Prayer, and other Holy Exercises—and whereas</hi> Adam <hi>had prayed in his Family, now many prayed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

But as to the thing, I do assert, that the generality of Learned men read it—<hi>call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:200297:49"/> the Name,</hi> &amp;c. and some of those who read—<hi>began to Prophane,</hi> &amp;c. give this reason for it, because they cannot think God's Publick Worship began so late as <hi>Enos</hi> his time. <hi>Drusius quaesit. per Epist.</hi> 18. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be sure there was a Publick setled Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in <hi>Melchisedec</hi>'s time, for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of which he had a Right to Tithes founded in Natural Equity: I proved this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by <hi>Melchisedec</hi>'s being a Priest, <hi>Gen.</hi> xiv. 18. and a Priest being ordained not for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate but publick Worship, and a setled Priest for setled Worship, we must suppose (as I noted) that <hi>Melchisedec</hi> neglected his Office, or else grant, there was a setled Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in his City, and in his Daies. Pincht with this <hi>T. E.</hi> hath left himself one starting hole, <hi>viz.</hi> that it was not <hi>[Outward Service]</hi> his Office consisted not in external Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies: what then? was there no Publick Worship in his Daies because it consisted not in Outward Service, or (as <hi>T. E.</hi> explains himself now) in Rites and Ceremonies? This is a strange Position, and would tend to prove, there is no Publick settled Worship, but what is Ceremonial. But he adds, <hi>no Outward Service for which Tithes might have been a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation;</hi> he means there was no <hi>Levitical Service</hi> some hundred years before <hi>Levi</hi> was born: a learned Inference! But how poorly doth he beg the Question, and suppose that no Priest-hood except <hi>Levi</hi>'s, no Service but Ceremonial, can have Tithes for a Compensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! There was Outward Worship per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:200297:50"/> by <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> and a Worship de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving as great a Compensation at least, and a Worship for which a Divinely inspired Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch thought he deserved Tithes, and therefore we conclude, There was a settled Worship in Publick then, and such as might have Tithes for a Compensation, though 'twere not <hi>Levitical.</hi> One weak pretence he hath, <hi>p.</hi> 44. against the consequence of <hi>Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decs</hi> performing publick worship at <hi>Salem</hi> where he resided, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>his residence is mentioned with relation to his Kingship:</hi> very well; now if the King had resided at <hi>Salem,</hi> and the Priest somewhere else, this had been notably argued, and would have helped the Papists to an old Type for their Transubstantiation: But since the same man was both King and Priest, and that one man was fixed at <hi>Salem,</hi> surely he discharged his Priestly as well as Kingly Office there, and that at other times as well as at this, and therefore had a Right to Tithes. Leaving therefore <hi>T. E</hi>'s poor shifts, the only reserves of an obstinate and baffled Adversary, I shall observe, that the same persons in that Age were Kings and Priests both: and hence it came to pass that Tithes which were paid to Kings by reason of their Priestly Office, continued in some places to be paid to them after the Offices were separated: so <hi>Pisistratus</hi> in his Letter to <hi>Solon</hi> mentions <hi>The priviledge of former Kings to have Tithes of every man's estate paid to them, which he now converted to the Service of the Gods</hi>

And this is all that is necessary to the main Question. But besides, it is now proved very probable that <hi>Abraham</hi> gave Tithes of all his Substance, as well as of his Spoils, and that <hi>Melchisedec</hi> was his Priest in Ordinary to whom he frequently gave Tithes, and with whom he and his did join in the Worship of God, which brings in Collateral strength to the main Question, and makes out the recognition of the Divine Right of Tithes, even in the Patriarch <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time.</p>

And it was conditional, which (he pretends) it was not in his power to have made it, if Tithes had been due before. I answer, <hi>David</hi> voluntarily vowed to keep God's Righteous Judgements, <hi>Psal.</hi> cxix. 106. and yet he was bound to keep them, by an obligation Antecedent to his vow; and though there was an antecedent obligation upon Tithes, yet <hi>Jacob</hi> might voluntarily vow them, for we see in the very same vow, and under the very same Condition which he vows Tithes; he also vows the Lord shall be his God; Did he not vow this voluntarily also? Did not Justice oblige him to take the Lord for his God, whether he had vowed it or no? Or was it in his power to make this obligation conditional? Must he not have owned his God, whether he had brought him back in peace or no? These are <hi>T. E</hi>'s only reasons why Tithes were not Due before this spontaneous conditional vow, and he may see they are frivolous, because they may be urged as well against the antecedent right of own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his God; and since that is joined with Tithes, he must confess the spontaneous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional vowing of Tithes, doth not prove they were not Due before. All that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand vows, know it is usual to vow things that ought to have been done without a vow; so <hi>Hannah</hi> voluntarily and conditionally too, vows her First-bon Son, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> i. 11. <hi>David</hi> vows to watch over his waies and his words,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:200297:54"/>
               <hi>Psal.</hi> xxxix. 1. and the Two Sacraments of the Gospel, are vows to perform the Duties of Christs Religion; and good men have used to secure their Duty, and quicken them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the performance of it, by these super-added Tyes, and voluntary Obligations: but indeed the condition of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s vow seems to be no more but this, <hi>If he lived, and had any estate out of which to pay Tithe:</hi> which was indeed a condition without which it had been impossible for him to have paid Tithes; and if he had dyed, or been so poor as to want all things, he could not have been obliged to pay Tithes by vow or antecedent obligation either. His Objection being thus removed we will now shew, how this instance makes out the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of Tithes before the Law. This is a second proof, That the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs then believed the Tenth to be that very part which specially belonged to God, and that part which God would have them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate to him in acknowledging of his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therefore by vowing this part, <hi>Jacob</hi> believed he should please God so well, as to move him to grant him his desire of preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and provision. And since God did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the vow, and perform those desires, and enable him to pay this vow; that proves he was actually pleased with his vowing that part, and withal declares that God had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen that part before, and manifested his Will concerning it. Since he is not wont to give such approbation to meer human Inventions, in things relating to his Service; and since it
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:200297:54"/> was the very same part which <hi>Abraham</hi> gave before, and both these Patriarchs who knew the will of God by Inspiration fixed upon this part; and neither they, nor any others, who were inspired in that Age, ever gave any other part upon record: Hence it follows, That we have in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Example, a second clear manifestation of the Will of God to have the Tenth part dedicated to him; and since Right is alwaies the measure of God's Will, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that the Tenth part is of Divine Right. Moreover we note, that since <hi>Jacob</hi> learned the proportion from <hi>Abraham,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from God, and <hi>Jacob</hi> gave a Tenth of all; 'tis like <hi>Abraham</hi> was wont to do so also. However, because we should alwaies take the best example and bountifullest side in making acknowledgments to God, therefore we ought to give Tithe of all that God gives us. But if <hi>T. E.</hi> stick to the Letter, and say, This is only an Instance and Example of Vowing Tithe of all, not of giving; yet the Holy Ghost in recording this vowing however (according to my Adversaries own inference) designed that for our Example, and that will shew, that our Ancestors did well in Vowing Tithes, and we cannot do ill in paying what they did well in Vowing for us as well as themselves; especially since if they had left us at liberty, it seems we ought to have Vowed Tithes our selves, and when we had done so, common justice would oblige us to pay them. And if the Quakers were (as they pretend) <hi>Abraham</hi>'s seed and true <hi>Israelites,</hi> they would do the works of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Israel, John</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:200297:55"/> viii. 39. But let us observe how <hi>Jacob</hi> here puts together, the Worship of God with its two great circumstances, a Place to Worship God in, and Maintenance to support that Worship; and as Tithes were fixed to a Priest before, so here they are annexed to a Temple, which we find endowed with all <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Tithe, long before the Ceremonial Law; and therefore to give Tithes to a Priest, and endow the House of God with Tithes, are Pious Acts, and are recorded as such for our Example by the Holy-Ghost, before the Law.</p>
            <p n="13">§. 13. PAg. 49. The Quaker beginning now to fear that Tithes will prove Due to <hi>Melchisedec</hi> in God's Right, would gladly cut us off from all claim by him, as being not of his Priest-hood. That Christ was of that Priest-hood, he grants; and denies not the Apostles to have been so too, yea and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confesses that <hi>Melchisedec</hi> had the same Priest-hood in some respects with the Ministers of the Gospel, from whence it follows that Christ &amp; his Apostles, and the Ministers of the Gospel, had and have the same Right to Tithes which <hi>Melchisedec</hi> had. But he only Questions whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I and my Brethren, (I suppose) be Ministers of the Gospel? I reply, that since 'tis the Quakers who Question it, we shall not do them the Honour to prove it to them: For they are a confused Croud that know not what the office means, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had other than <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Ordination among them, <hi>Whosoever would,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> xiii. 33. Speakers without Authority or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Succession, Deputation, or Imposition of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:200297:55"/> hands; and shall we do our Sacred Office that Dishonour to prove it to them, whenas it hath been proved to better Judges<note n="(a)" place="margin">See <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> de Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterio Anglicano.</note> by Scripture, Antiquity, and invincible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and is approved by all Foreign Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Churches, allowed by our Kings, our Parliaments, and our Laws, and the Office it self was conferred on us in a more solemn and Primitive manner than it is on any Clergy under Heaven? I should be ridiculous to go about to prove to a naked <hi>Indian,</hi> that my Hat or Band sat decently, when Civilized people thought they did. <hi>Contra negantem principia non est Disputandum;</hi> these wild En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasts say the Order is or ought to be Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, and so it is utterly among them, who are therefore no Judges of this matter. <hi>T. E.</hi> proves his Mothers honesty (which I thought needed no more be questioned than my Priest-hood) by publick Fame only; and I will prove my Priest-hood no otherwise to him: Supposing therefore his Mother to have been unquestionably honest, and that I am unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionably a Minister of the Gospel; it follows then, that I am of <hi>Melchisedec</hi>'s Priest-hood in some respects. The Fathers (whom I only named before) affirm that the Gospel Ministry (without respect to their own or any particular Age) are so, and 'tis a frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Cavil of <hi>T. E.</hi> to pretend they spoke of their own Clergy, not those of this Age, since though the persons change, the Office of a Gospel Minister is still the same. <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> saith, Abraham <hi>offered to one that in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:200297:56"/> Ʋncircumcision celebrated Divine Offices, that the Priest-hood of the Circumcision might not proudly contradict the Priest-hood of Holy Church. Lest the Priestly Dignity should be settled in the old Priest-hood, it seemed necessary to Translate it to that Priest-hood after the Order of</hi> Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedec, <hi>which was before</hi> Aaron <hi>and</hi> Levi, <hi>which verily now flourisheth in the Church from Christ to our daies, since we choose no more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the succession of Kindred, but require a similitude in Vertue.</hi> Epiph. <hi>contr. haer. l.</hi> 2. <hi>T.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 209. St. <hi>Hierom</hi> clearly supposes also our Priest-hood (which he calls the Priest-hood of the Uncircumcised Church) to be the same with <hi>Melchisedec</hi>'s Question in <hi>Gen.</hi> Tom. 3. p. 328. <hi>Steph. Tornacensis</hi> expresly calls Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Priests <hi>the Successors of</hi> Melchisedec, <hi>lib. Epist.</hi> 171. And <hi>Isidore</hi> of <hi>Hispalis</hi> said, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>by Prophesie gave Tithes to</hi> Melchisedec, <hi>knowing there was to be a better Priest-hood among the Gentiles than the Levitical ever was.</hi> Isid. <hi>ap. Gloss. ord. in</hi> Gen. 16. Hence our Writers generally speak of them as one, <hi>The</hi> Melchisedecian <hi>or</hi> Christian <hi>order.</hi> Gauden <hi>of Tithes, p.</hi> 11. That I may not therefore multiply proofs in a plain Case, I shall only note that <hi>Fulk</hi> and <hi>Willet</hi>'s Opinion would not signifie much against so much greater Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; but indeed they were Disputing against the Papists, who would prove their Sacrifice of the Mass, and Sacrificing Priest-hood for expiation, by their being of <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedec</hi>'s Order. Now we challenge no such Priest-hood, and do declare Christ the only
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:200297:56"/> Priest, whose Sacrifice did properly expiate; and as Christ's Priest-hood consisted in offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Expiatory Sacrifice, we do with <hi>Willet</hi> and <hi>Fulk</hi> confess he hath no Successor: that sort of Priest-hood rested only in Christ, and though <hi>Willet</hi> suppose <hi>Melchisedec</hi>'s was such a Priest-hood, I see no reason to believe that: and I am perswaded it was that false concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (<hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Melchisedec</hi>'s Priest-hood did offer expiatory Sacrifices) which drove the Doctor to as false an Assertion, <hi>That</hi> Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedec <hi>had no Successor but Christ:</hi> But for us, we affirm <hi>Melchisedec</hi>'s Worship was only Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual (as far as appears) praising God and blessing in his Name; and ours is so too, and since we have the same kind of Duties, why should we not be of the same Order, and so receive the same Reward? The Fathers thought all this reasonable, and so will every impartial man: Nay 'tis likely <hi>Willet</hi> and <hi>Fulk</hi> would not have denied it to any but Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists with their sacrificing Priest-hood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 51. The rest of this Chapter is spent for the most part in the Vindication of his Non-sensical proof of our not being of the Order of <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> which was, <hi>That he was not made a Priest after the Law of a carnal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, but after the power of an Endless life,</hi> Heb. vii. 16. and (he saith) <hi>Every one knows we are not so made Priests;</hi> which when I justly charge as impertinently applyed in my 41 <hi>Page,</hi> he is forced to confess (for all his brags) <hi>That he used the Apostles phrase only by
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:200297:57"/> way of allusion, which did not Tye his sense to the Subject St.</hi> Paul <hi>was upon:</hi> Very strange! What not when the Quaker was upon the same Subject himself, and brought this in Dispute as a proof? Did every one know before that <hi>T. E.</hi> had this trick to abuse the Apostles words to a sense in which their holy Author never meant them? I wish all that Read Quakers Books did know and consider this, that is so usual a cheat with them, <hi>viz. To use Scripture phrases to quite other purposes than they were intended,</hi> that their shallow Disciples may swallow Errors and Lies cloathed in mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aplyed words of Scripture, and take them all for Divine Truths. <hi>T. E.</hi> hath been suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently exposed for this impious dishonesty already, <hi>The Priests bearing rule by their Means: The Demonstration of the Spirit and Power,</hi> &amp;c. and deserves a Black-cole for this: Well, but our main Enquiry is, what was St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s sense of those two Phrases, 1. <hi>The Law of a carnal Commandment.</hi> 2. <hi>The power of an endless Life.</hi> And since those Phrases are not elsewhere in Scripture, they must be explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the coherence of this place, where St. <hi>Paul</hi> is differencing Christ's Priest-hood and <hi>Melchisedec</hi>'s, only from that of <hi>Levi;</hi> so that it was the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priest-hood which St. <hi>Paul</hi> means was made after the Law of a carnal Commandment; and so Christian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tepreters Expound it. <hi>Which</hi> Melchisedec <hi>was not made as the Legal Priests were, for they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their Priest-hood by the Law that had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Commandments: for it saith, Circumcise the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:200297:57"/> Flesh, wash the Flesh.</hi> Theophilact. <hi>in loc.</hi> And St. <hi>Chrysostom, Well did he call the Law, a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Commandment, for all that it decreed were carnal Things.</hi> Chrys. <hi>Tom.</hi> 5. <hi>mihi pag.</hi> 501. Yea St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>the Ceremonial Law,</hi> a Law that had <hi>Carnal Ordinances,</hi> Heb. ix. 10. and expresses it by the very Name of the Flesh, <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 3. as tending to the purifying of the Flesh, <hi>Heb.</hi> ix. 13. So that to be made a Priest after the Law of a carnal Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s sense, to be made a Priest according to the Ceremonies of <hi>Moses</hi> Law: and now every one knows <hi>T. E.</hi> spoke Non-sense, when he said, <hi>We were made Priests by the Law of a carnal Commandment.</hi> The second Phrase is, <hi>After the Power of an Endless Life;</hi> which, in the Apostles sense, is some way that is contrary to the Ceremonial Law, and because <hi>Flesh,</hi> and that which is <hi>Carnal,</hi> is corruptible and liable to change, as the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law was; therefore this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite branch must signifie, <hi>That which hath the power of continuing for ever.</hi> And St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom</hi> notes that St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not put in the direct contrary in Terms, and say, <hi>But by the Law of a Spiritual Commandment,</hi> but changes his Phrase, and saies, <hi>But after the power of an endless Life, to shew</hi> (saith he) <hi>that by a carnal Commandment he intended the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law, which endured but for a time.</hi> Chrys. <hi>ubi supr.</hi> Yea, St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself declares he means no more by this Phrase, than that he was made a Priest according to a Law that should endure for ever, since he proves it by
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:200297:58"/> the words of the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> cx. 4. <hi>Thou art a Priest for ever,</hi> &amp;c. which he brings in (as the proof of this) in the very next Verse. And indeed the Law of Nature, after which <hi>Melchisedec</hi> was made a Priest; and the Law of the Gospel, after which we are made Priests, have in them the power of an End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Life. These Laws are never to be changed, and therefore the Priest-hood also is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable by the Apostles own Argument, <hi>vers.</hi> 12. This is the sense of those Phrases in plain <hi>English,</hi> which proves we are Priests according to the Order of <hi>Melchisedec;</hi> so that I need not strive to avoid the force of them at all, and <hi>T. E</hi>'s talk <hi>Of having the power of an Endless Life nearer to us than in the Duty,</hi> is meer Canting and Non-sense. And as soon as we strip him of this misty Cloke of <hi>Phrase-Divinity,</hi> his nakedness most shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully appears. I conclude, that a Priest who was not made after <hi>Moses</hi> changeable Law had Tithes paid to him, and that his Priest-hood and ours agree in this, That the Law to which his Priest-hood was affixed, was to continue for ever, and so is that to which our Priest-hood is affixed also. Oh but <hi>pag.</hi> 55. our Priest-hood is not unchangeable, <hi>Because many Turns and Changes have been among us: One while, a Popish Priest-hood; another, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant, yea an Episcopal Priest-hood; a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial; and an Independent.</hi> Well observed! for Independents have no Priest-hood at all; this is as wise as he that said, There were four sorts of Government, Monarchy, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocracy,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:200297:58"/> Democracy, and Anarchy (making <hi>No Government</hi> to be one sort of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.) But to the thing, these were no Changes in the Office it self; for all these that were Priests, pretended to be made Priests according to the same Law, though they came to it by different Rites. None of these abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated the Old Office, and set up any New one; yea the very Presbyterians owned, That we were rightly made Priests; and indeed since our Ordination is Episcopal, we affirm and can prove, there never was any essential Change in our Office since the Apostles time, for there never wanted a succession of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Priests; and different Rites of Admission do not create a New Office: So that thus also ours is an unchangeable Priest-hood, <hi>pag.</hi> 56. But he urges, <hi>We have more work to do than</hi> Melchisedec, Ergo, <hi>our Office is not the same.</hi> I Reply, That if it be so, sure our reward should not be less than <hi>Melchisedec</hi>'s, when our Work is greater, a Tenth then at least we may claim by this Argument; besides, <hi>T. E.</hi> cannot be sure <hi>Melchisedec</hi> had no more work to do than that which is recorded, <hi>Gen.</hi> xiv. but suppose he had no more; a new Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty annexed to an old Office, doth not make the Office new. <hi>T. E.</hi> will grant, Christ was a Priest of <hi>Melchisedec</hi>'s Order, yet Christ was to Offer himself upon the Cross, which <hi>Melchisedec</hi> was not to do, nay it was more than he had to do for certain; yet Christ was of the same Order, and if God, or our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Governours, have annexed some new
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:200297:59"/> Duties to the Old Office, it doth not follow that we are not of the same Order: I am sure, for the main, our Offices are the same; his Spiritual, so is ours; his to Praise God, so is ours; his to Bless the People, so is ours. Nor do we Curse any, but such whose Crimes made them first liable to the curse of God: And should we bless the Covetous whom God abhorreth? Should we Bless detainers of God's dues, when he Curses them, <hi>Mal.</hi> iii. 9. Did St. <hi>Peter</hi> bless <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> for keeping back dedicated things, <hi>Acts</hi> v? or those that beguiled unstable Souls, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 14? Or did St. <hi>Paul</hi> Bless Apostates, Ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuous Persons, and such as came with new Revelations, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. <hi>Gal.</hi> i. 8? The Apostles Cursed such as acted like our Quakers; and indeed it is our Duty to Curse these: yea since our Cursing is only designed to bring them to Repentance, it is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est blessing to them when it hath this effect; and no doubt <hi>Melchisedec</hi> would himself have been as ready to Curse an Evil man for his amendment, as to bless a Good man: in this then we differ not from him, and so are Priests after the Order of <hi>Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec.</hi> And doing the same Duties, we may expect the same Reward, <hi>viz.</hi> to receive that Tenth part which was so ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared, and so often recognized to be God's Due before the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law, and even then paid to one that bore the same kind of Office we now sustain. And thus much we have Learned toward the proof of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:200297:59"/> Tithes being now Due <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> from the first period.</p>

               <p>PAg. 59. This Chapter is introduced with telling his abused Reader, <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto</hi> (saith he) <hi>no Right to Tithes appears:</hi> Meaning surely, in his own Book, wherein he stifled most of the material proofs, and confounded the Order of the Rest, on purpose to keep that Right from appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which my Discourse had sufficiently made out. And indeed the business of his Book is not to disprove the Right by solid Arguments, but to hide it by a heap of Words, that his Quakers may not discern it; and to carry on that design, he begins this Second Period, relating to the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law, with a manifest falshood, saying, <hi>These Priests dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim all Right and Tithe by that Law:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I only said, <hi>We do not claim Tithes by vertue of it,</hi> pag. 42. We do not claim by it as it is Ceremonial, <hi>pag.</hi> 49. Had I made such an Alteration in his Words, it would have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded Matter for one Page at least, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play the dishonesty of it. But I shall only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, That I brought many Arguments from the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law to strengthen our claim by other Laws, and though our Right rely
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:200297:60"/> not upon that Law, yet by fair inference it may be justified from it, so that the word <hi>(Disclaim)</hi> was never used by me, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps invented by him, to invalidate those col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral proofs I brought from thence, which he knew not how to answer, without the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie of such an Invention. His tedious digression to justifie <hi>Burroughs</hi> his calling <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>'s the First Priest-hood, hath nothing in it like an Argument, but only that in our Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the Jewish Covenant is called, <hi>The first Covenant,</hi> Heb. viii. 7. and ix. 1. yet most other Versions, particularly <hi>Beza, Tremelius, Vatablus,</hi> and St. <hi>Hierom</hi> turn <gap reason="foreign">

Again, he labours, <hi>pag.</hi> 61. to excuse himself from skipping three or four Pages in the beginning of the Friendly Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; two Sentences of which he nibbles at <hi>pag.</hi> 282, 283. and then omits his Answer to another part of those beginning Pages for thirty Leaves together, <hi>viz.</hi> till Page 348,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:200297:60"/> 349. and to answer so disjointedly, is no just answer; and besides, as for many other pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in those first three or four Pages of my Friends Book, he never once attempted any Reply unto. So that this rambling introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, neither clears himself nor his Friend, nor doth it any Service to the Question, to which we will now proceed.</p>
               <p n="1">§. 1. PAg. 62. Under the Second Period <hi>T. E.</hi> thinks two things are chiefly to be enquired, 1. <hi>Whether Tithes were a part of the Ceremonial Law?</hi> 2. <hi>Whether they were abrogated by Christ?</hi> These two things are in effect but one, if he had stated the first right, <hi>viz. Whether Tithes were purely Ceremonial?</hi> (as I had exprest it) for so, the one necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily includes the other; prove them purely Ceremonial, and that shews they were abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by Christ; and prove them abrogated by Christ, and that shews them purely Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial. And on the contrary, the proving (as I did) they were not abrogated by Christ, shews they were not purely Ceremonial. He knows I granted in my 45 Page, that under <hi>Moses</hi> Law there were several Appendages to Tithes which were purely Ceremonial and abrogated; but Tithes themselves, as they are that <hi>Quota</hi> of Maintenance, are neither Ceremonial nor abrogated by the abrogation of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law. To this he Replies, <hi>They were commanded by that Law, and never commanded by any other, and so must fall when
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:200297:61"/> that Law fell.</hi> I answer, any sufficient indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's Will hath the force of a Law, and inspired Patriarchs (as I have proved) had a sufficient indication of God's Will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Quota</hi> before the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law, wherefore they were commanded before, as Sacrifices were, and although that Law be not written, yet the practice of Holy men relying on it, is Recorded, which makes it evident to us, they Acted by God's direction in the Choice of that part, so that <hi>T. E.</hi> is too bold to say, <hi>They were never commanded by any other Law.</hi> The Command was not written till <hi>Moses</hi> Law, no more were the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and yet <hi>T. E.</hi> dares not say they fell with <hi>Moses</hi> Law, but indeed his Argument would serve an <hi>Antinomian</hi> who might say, <hi>The Ten Commandments were commanded by that Law, and never Commanded by any other, that is upon record before, and hence might infer the abrogation of Moral Duties.</hi> Besides there were many Virtues of Eternal Obligation for which no Written Law appears before the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical</hi> Law, as may be seen in these Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples<note n="(a)" place="margin">Exod. xxiii. 1.8. Levit. xix. 11, 16, 17, 35. Numb. xxx. 2. Deut. vi. 5.</note>, and yet no man of Modesty will pretend these fell with <hi>Moses</hi> Law. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Seventh part of our time, which God hath a peculiar Right to, as well as to the Tenth part of our Estate, is herein paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to the present Case; for there is no Law to enjoin this upon Record before the <hi>Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Law, and yet even Quakers themselves by Meeting on those Daies seem to own, that the <hi>Quota,</hi> i. e. one Day in seven, is not
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:200297:61"/> Ceremonial nor abrogated with <hi>Moses</hi> Law, wherein the first and only Divine Command is on Record for it. The superinduced Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Ceremonies, as to the manner of observing one Day in Seven indeed are abrogated, as the Appendages of their peculiar way of Tithing are: But the <hi>Quota,</hi> as to both these, remains still, one Day in Seven, one part of Ten, <hi>pag.</hi> 62. But he cunningly Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, <hi>Tithes are not the Maintenance it self, but the Modes of that Maintenance, the means and waies by which it was raised.</hi> This Notion he is very proud of, and repeats it often, yea fancies, <hi>pag.</hi> 63. that it would much conduce to the determining of the Controversie, when indeed it is a silly mistake, and only conduces to shew us that <hi>T. E.</hi> cannot distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Quantum</hi> and <hi>Quomodo;</hi> for Tithes are the <hi>Quantum</hi> and <hi>Quota,</hi> and cannot proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called a Mode; for even this Tenth may be raised in several Modes, and by divers waies; it was raised one way among the Jews, and is raised another among us; their Mode of Tithing and ours do vastly differ, and those Ceremonial Modes which were peculiar to them are abrogated, but the <hi>Quantum</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains the same that it was before <hi>Moses</hi> Law; and Tithes are the Maintenance it self fixed into one Determinate part, which fixed and determinate Maintenance remains unmoved, how many alterations soever there be in the manner of raising this determinate Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; even as the Worship of the true God remains unmoved, how many alterations so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:200297:62"/> there be in the Modes of celebrating this Worship: But <hi>T. E.</hi> seems to like rather, that Worship, in general, should be compared to Maintenance in general; which, if we grant, then some one determinate sort of Worship will answer one determinate sort of Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <hi>i. e.</hi> Tithes; suppose Praise, which was <hi>Melchisedec</hi>'s Worship, may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to Tithes, <hi>Melchisedec</hi>'s sort of Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. Now Praise was not by any written Command enjoined before the Law, only it may be proved to belong to God by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of inspired Patriarchs; it was Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the Law, with divers Ceremonial Modes, which were abrogated with the <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> Law, as the Ceremonial Modes of Tith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were, yet the Duty remains in force still, as to the main. And the place he produces in his 63 <hi>page</hi> (out of my 43 <hi>page</hi>) gives us the exact Character of a thing purely Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial, and sufficiently shews, Tithes were not so, for they were not Modes, but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate sort of Maintenance, they were not proper to that Dispensation, but paid before it, and afterward too. They had no relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Christ to come, nor were they Types of any thing in the Gospel; so that Tithes are not Ceremonial: Nor indeed were they instituted in the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law, but claimed at first as due before, which I proved in my 44 <hi>page,</hi> and he never Answered it. As for his blunder about Sacrifices and Circumcision, the only Instances of things Ceremonial pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed before the Law; they will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:200297:62"/> Tithes were so, since they were both by Name expresly repealed under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which Tithes are not. And that obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation affords this undoubted ground to prove that Tithes are not purely Ceremonial, <hi>viz. Whatsoever was practiced by inspired Patriarchs before the Law, and was prescribed under the Law, and is not by Name repealed in the Gospel, that is not to be accounted purely Ceremonial;</hi> But Tithes were practiced before the Law, and prescribed under it, yet are not repealed by name under the Gospel, and so are not purely Ceremonial nor abrogated by Christ.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. PAg. 63. This whole Section is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed before, where we shewed that <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Vow was voluntary and conditional, as to the Lord's being his God, which yet was a known Duty before, as well as giving or paying Tithes: only we note that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> the Jesuit first urged <hi>T. E</hi>'s fallacious Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz. That if Tithes had been a known Duty,</hi> Jacob <hi>ought not to have vowed them,</hi> Tom. 1. Con. 5. l. 1. cap. 25. but the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going instances, together with <hi>Nehem.</hi> x. 25. <hi>Jer.</hi> xxxiv. 8. shew the Jesuit and Quaker both are grosly mistaken. How Tithes are mentioned, <hi>Exod.</hi> xxii. 19. and claimed with respect to Antecedent right, <hi>Levit.</hi> xxvii. long before the setling them on the <hi>Levites, Numb.</hi> xviii. is shewed before also: So that I shall only add, that as God promised to give <hi>Jacob</hi> the Land of <hi>Cannaan,</hi> and it is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:200297:63"/> said, he performed that promise in giving it to his Posterity; so <hi>Jacob</hi> who promised God to give him the Tenth of all he should give him, may be said to perform this Vow in his Posterities, paying the Tenths of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> by his Vow laid a more particular Obligation upon them to pay Tenths, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to confirm God's antecedent Right. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>T. E.</hi> notes, that a little before God claims Tithes, he claims the whole Land and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines that such a claim doth not prove God's antecedent Right to Tithes any more than his claim of the whole Land, shews he had any antecedent Right to the whole Land. I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, 'tis well he laies it upon this parallel, for this claim doth suppose he had a Right to the whole Land before, and indeed he had a Right to it antecedent to that claim, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by his giving it to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> xiii. 15. to <hi>Isaac, Gen.</hi> xxvi. 3. and to <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> xxxv. 12. long before; unless <hi>T. E.</hi> will say, that God gave that which he had no Right to. So that the claim to the Land, and to Tithes being expressed alike, and it being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain God had an antecedent Right to the Land (forfeited to him by the wickedness of the Inhabitants); it follows God had also an antecedent Right to Tithes, and so they had not their beginning with the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law.</p>

                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:200297:63"/>§. 3. PAg. 64. Here again the Quaker enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains his Reader with putting his own sense upon my Comparisons, only to hide his crafty leaving out that which most directly concerned the main Question, <hi>viz. What was Ceremonial in Tithes under</hi> Moses <hi>Law, and abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by Christ;</hi> the particulars I reckoned up in my 44 and 45 <hi>pages,</hi> such as restraining them to one Tribe, bringing in the First-Tithe to the <hi>Levites</hi> in Specie, Tithing the <hi>Levites</hi> for the Priests, offering the second Tithe at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> for the Feasts; these with other circumstances were the Modes and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Appendages to the fixed determinate Maintenance of Tithes, these like a Sute were put on, upon the old proportion of a Tenth part, which subsisted before these Vestments were superinduced, and remained after they were taken away again. And this fixed proportion I accounted justly to be Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential (not in respect to Maintenance in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, as <hi>T. E.</hi> doth weakly suggest, but) in respect to those Ceremonial Modes, which he durst not produce my Catalogue of, for fear his Reader should have discerned a vast difference between the fixed proportion of a Tenth part, and the variable Modes of raising, paying, or distributing it; that being alwaies the same, this changing under various dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, even as it was also in the Case of the Seventh part of our time, that was blessed at the Creation, probably observed before the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:200297:64"/> Law, prescribed in the Law, continuing now after the Law, and not Ceremonial, but the Modes annexed by <hi>Moses</hi> Law, were only su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinduced for a time, and ceased with that Law, that first annexed them to the main and standing Order of one Day in Seven, which may be called Essential as to the time of God's Worship, in comparison of those lesser vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Ceremonies once joined to it. Thus far then the Tenth part appears not to be Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial nor abrogated, not beginning with that Law, nor peculiar to it, nor yet Typical of Christ, remaining the same when its Modes altered; and now let us see what can be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed toward the Right of God to this Tenth part under the Gospel, by what was said or done about it during the Ceremonial Law.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. PAg. 65. Divers Lessons I observed were to be learned thence; The first of which the Quaker (a fit Advocate for such a bad Cause) doth cunningly conceal by a base Equivocation, <hi>One of his Lessons</hi> (saith he) <hi>is</hi>—and then he Cites my <hi>Second,</hi> which is <hi>one</hi> indeed of my Lessons, but not that <hi>one,</hi> he should first have spoken to, but it seems the <hi>First</hi> did not please him, and therefore both in my 25 <hi>page,</hi> and here in my 46 <hi>page</hi> he claps it under Deck, and no first Lesson appears. But because he dreads it so much, I will once more produce it, <hi>First this shews how God continued his Claim to Tithes which were his Dues before, it shews his approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the payment of them by the Patriarchs, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:200297:64"/> confirms the disposal of them to God's Ministers, and makes good the Prescription against them that are not his Ministers,</hi> pag. 46. that is, the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical</hi> Law doth confirm my two former Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions. 1. That the Tenth was God's part. 2. That his Ministers were to be his Receivers. Though all the Land was Gods, yet he speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally claims for his peculiar portion, <hi>All the Tithe;</hi> the same part which <hi>Abraham, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> fixed on; had he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked that part, he would have chosen another, but his claim shews he liked that, and proves that the Patriarchs were directed, not by fancy (which God uses not to follow) but by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation in that choice, nor could the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty have confirmed the Patriarchs choice more illustriously than by so solemn a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his Approbation; and the practice of God's own people for near 2000 years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, doth still give credit to this Tenth part, and make out the prescription for that against all other parts. And Secondly for the Ministers being God's Receivers also, for to those who were his Ministers then, they were assigned, <hi>Numb.</hi> xviii. 21. and to no other, and by them they were enjoyed while they were his Ministers. And since God hath chosen another Ministry, and they need Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance also, and deserve no less a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we cannot but judge they should have at least this Tenth, which was all along God's part: Which brings me to the <hi>Second</hi> of my Lessons, <hi>viz. That this was a Pattern for Christ to imitate in his Provision for the Gospel
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:200297:65"/> Ministers,</hi> which I proved from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who having shewed how and in what manner the Jewish Ministry was provided for under the Law, adds, <hi>Even so hath the Lord ordained,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. 13, 14. As they lived of God's portion, so should these; the maintenance was alike in the main: Theirs fixed, so ours; theirs Honourable, so ours; theirs such as would allow them to attend continually on their Ministry, and that being our Duty, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 15. our maintenance ought to be sutable, which St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> also observes, when shewing how God provided for the <hi>Levites,</hi> so as they might not be taken off from Divine Administrations, he saith, <hi>Quae nunc ratio &amp; forma in clero tenetur.</hi> Cypr. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>Epist.</hi> 9. <hi>The same reason, and the same form is held in the [Maintenance of the] Clergy now;</hi> which words do fully Expound the Apostles <hi>[Even so]:</hi> And <hi>T. E. pag.</hi> 67. grants that this <hi>[Even so]</hi> implies, <hi>That Christ was not less careful of his Ministers under the Gospel, than God had been of his Priests under the Law.</hi> From which concession it follows, that Christ hath provided as good a Maintenance for his Ministers as the <hi>Levites</hi> had. And though it be not the same in all circumstances, it must not be a less proportion, nor left arbitrary and unfixed; for God was so careful as to provide a certain, determinate, fixed, necessary Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for the <hi>Levites,</hi> and would Christ have been as careful of his Ministers, if he had only provided an uncertain, variable, free and arbitrary Maintenance for them,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:200297:65"/> as <hi>T. E.</hi> (in contradiction to his own conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) would perswade us. If <hi>T. E</hi>'s Father have two younger Sons, and he give one a perpetual Rent-charge, well settled on him and his Heirs for ever, out of the Elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Estate, and leave the other wholly to the Courtesie of his Elder Brother, only charging him to give him Maintenance in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; will the Quaker say his Father was as careful of this younger Son, as he was of the other? If he were that Son who were left to Courtesie, no doubt he would change provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with his Brother, and think his Father had been less careful of him. And 'tis most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd to imagine, St. <hi>Paul</hi> would compare the Gospel provision to the Legal, with [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] if it had been unlike in all things; for all the <hi>Lexicographers</hi> assure us, these are Notes of Similitude, and used in rendering compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons<note n="(b)" place="margin">

                  </note>. So 'tis certain there is a Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and a Comparison here between these two, which proves Christ did take the Law for a Pattern in making like provision for his Ministers, though not in all points the very same.</p>
               <p>Pag. 27. My Third Lesson (which he dares not call so, for fear of awaking the first, as yet unanswered) is, <hi>That this was a Pattern for the primitive Christians also, and taught them to give their Ministers an Honourable Maintenance;</hi> This the Quaker confesses, but would affright us from imitating them by falsly suggesting, <hi>That the Levitical Law was but too much imitated by the Christians in the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:200297:66"/> Ages succeeding that of the Apostles;</hi> and he that Reads the Writings of those times (saith <hi>T. E.</hi>) will find no cause to question it. We are sure, <hi>T. E.</hi> that affirms this, hath Read very few of those Writings, and therefore he hath cause to Question this, that he so confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently asserts; and I appeal to those who have Read them all, if this be not an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant slander: for who Disputes more Learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against Ceremonies, than <hi>Justin Mart. Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Alexandrin. Irenaeus, Origen, Eusebius, Epiphanius,</hi> and St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> who fully shew they are all abrogated, and yet even these are (some of them) our witnesses for Tithes? And if <hi>T. E.</hi> pretend he mean this of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church in after Ages, let him look upon his own Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 88. where his dear Friend <hi>Brute,</hi> speaking of the Popish Clergy, saith, <hi>They care nothing at all for other, as well the great as the small Ceremonies of the Law:</hi> But I am speaking of the Primitive Christians, and can make it very evident that they believed, since the <hi>Levites</hi> had a Tenth part, the Christians ought not to give less than a Tenth part<note n="(c)" place="margin">Hilariter &amp; liberè dantes ea, non quae sunt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora, utpote majorm spem ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentes. <hi>Iraen.</hi> l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>34.</hi> Saltem Judaeorum imitemur exordia. <hi>Hieron.</hi> in <hi>Mal.</hi>

They thought they might and ought to give more, in gratitude for the better dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation they lived under, but by no means allowed them to give less. And when they advised or actually gave the Tenth, with any mention of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law, it was not because they
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:200297:66"/> thought that Law about them was now in force, for then they should have restored Tithe with all the Ceremonial Appendages; only they urge it as a Pattern, and have regard to the fixed part, <hi>the Tenth,</hi> as fixed before the Law, continued under the Law, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver repealed, as being no Type of any thing under the Gospel. And it was that power and efficacy of the Gospel which <hi>T. E.</hi> speaks of <hi>p.</hi> 68. which opened their hearts to give so freely in times of trouble, and to make set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled Donations of Tithes as soon as the Church was in a condition to receive them: and since we count that Maintenance honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable enough, which our pious Ancestors (upon so excellent grounds) freely gave us, we do not vary from Christs Example, who lived upon what was freely given him, and yet the difference of that time when Christ first began to plant the Gospel; and this, when it is planted and settled, shews we are not bound to unsettle all again, meerly to imitate the first beginnings of Christianity, any more than we should burn our Cloaths and go naked (as some Quakers upon this principle have done in these parts) because <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> did so.</p>

And a great man in this sort of Learning saith, <hi>The Tithing of Herbs was only of Ecclesiastical Institution, and yet it hath our Saviours approbation, partly for the Equity of the thing, and the consonancy of it to the Law and to Reason, partly because it was prescribed by the Sanhedrin, who sat in</hi> Moses <hi>Chair</hi>

                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:200297:68"/> granted Tithes Ceremonial, and begs the Question that they are so, and then weakly runs on for a Page or two, to shew <hi>That it cannot be Christ should bid his Disciples exceed Pharisees in exact observing of Ceremonies, and must not be believed upon</hi> Origen<hi>'s word nor mine:</hi> Whenas neither <hi>Origen</hi> nor I ever said any such thing concerning Ceremonies, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Tithes, which he and I both, have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and proved were not Ceremonial; so miserably doth the Quaker mistake the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors he would pretend to Dispute against. I shall now only make a Remark or two on this part of his Discourse, and pass on. And <hi>First,</hi> since <hi>Origen</hi> is so apt to Allegorize, and so seldom Expounds according to the Letter (as <hi>Selden</hi> tells <hi>T. E.</hi>) that makes this literal Interpretation of this place more valuable, and shews he could not possibly make Tithes a Type; and since <hi>Origen</hi> (as <hi>T. E.</hi> by retail again from <hi>Selden, pag.</hi> 40.) advises, <hi>To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what things are to be Literally taken in the Law, and what not;</hi> we ought to believe he considered this piece of the Law well, in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance of his own Rule, and upon mature deliberation thought Tithes still in force. <hi>Secondly, pag.</hi> 71. <hi>T. E.</hi> mistakes to think, <hi>Judgment, Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> are called the weightier matters of the Law, in respect to Tithes in General, which are an Act of <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Fidelity</hi> (for they are so called but in respect of Tithing Mint, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nise, and Cummin, those small things scarce legible in the Letter of <hi>Moses</hi> Law. <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:200297:68"/> He saith, <hi>It would puzzle a wiser Citator to find out who</hi> Origen<hi>'s</hi> Levite <hi>is;</hi> 'tis like it puzzles him, and he thinks himself a <hi>wise Citator.</hi> But I suppose few of his intelligent Readers think so, and this ignorant Sentence proves him none of the wisest; for nothing more Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary in the Fathers, than to call all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Ministers, <hi>Levites;</hi> St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> calls the Apostles so. <hi>Adv. haer. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 20. and St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> calls himself so, and every young Student can cite him twenty such expressions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page</hi> 72. But since Reason fails him, he will try what Authority will do, and therefore he confutes <hi>Origen,</hi> St. <hi>Hierom, Hilary,</hi> and St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> by the greater Testimonies of <hi>Brute, Erasmus,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Willet,</hi> the two last Learned men indeed, but such as never thought their Opinion of more Authority than the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. As for <hi>Brute,</hi> he is most justly to be despised, as one more illiterate than he that cites him, and this Quotation proves him so. For he will not allow that these words— <hi>Ought ye to have done:</hi> sound as a Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yea he is so bruitish as to think the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees, <hi>Out of Coveteousness made great account of Tithes, because of their own singular commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. T. E. p.</hi> 73. whence 'tis plain this ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Man thought Tithes had been paid to the Pharisees, and grosly fancyed they were Priests, though 'tis certain their strictness was in paying, not in receiving Tithes, <hi>Luk.</hi> xviii. 12. And <hi>Brute</hi>'s mistake is so obvious, that a well Catechised Child would laugh at him
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:200297:69"/> for it. Again, he boldly saith, Christ did not promise his Apostles a Temporal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when they forsook all for him: di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to St. <hi>Mark</hi> and St. <hi>Luke,</hi> who say, Christ promised them Houses and Lands even in this World, <hi>Mark</hi> x. 30. <hi>Luke</hi> xviii. 30. (and made that Promise good, <hi>Acts</hi> iv. 34, 35. as Commentators observe). Finally he impertinently cites the words of our Saviour, and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> vi. 8. applying it only to Ministers, when they speak to all Christians; and Ministers are no more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by them to renounce their Tithes, than the people are to renounce their nine parts. But <hi>T. E.</hi> may see Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> had the same Opinion of <hi>Brute, Thorp,</hi> and the rest of his Tithe-opposing Martyrs, that I have; for he declares he thinks much <hi>to stuff his Book with their Arguments;</hi> and indeed 'tis plain, he thought them not worth Transcribing. <hi>Hist. Tithes, chap.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 167. And of <hi>Erasmus</hi> his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the same <hi>Selden</hi> saith in the next Page: <hi>But that [Opinion] of his, divers have suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently both reprehended and exploded.</hi> But these words of <hi>Erasmus</hi> cited by <hi>T. E.</hi> here, <hi>(viz. That God commanded them for a time to be kept, according to the Flesh)</hi> do not imply that Tithes themselves were Ceremonial, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that under that Law they were to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for that time with their Ceremonial Appendages: And 'tis probable <hi>Erasmus</hi> did not hold Tithes (as now claimed) to be Ceremonial, because he himself took Tithes when Arch Bishop <hi>Warham</hi> gave him the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:200297:69"/> of <hi>Aldington</hi> in <hi>Kent.</hi> See <hi>Kilburn</hi>'s Survey, <hi>pag.</hi> 10. Which reason holds also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Dr. <hi>Willet,</hi> who received Tithes of a Parsonage in <hi>Cambridgeshire:</hi> 'Tis true, he with <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the <hi>Jesuits</hi> agree, that Tithes are not Moral. <hi>Synops. Pap. p.</hi> 313. But even in <hi>T. E</hi>'s own Book, Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> is cited saying, <hi>They were a judicial constitution,</hi> p. 92. and <hi>that it is lawful to keep that Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,</hi> pag. 91. <hi>and that they are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,</hi> pag. 92. Now dare any man say, that a Judicial and Ceremonial constitution are all one, or that a thing Ceremonial in its Nature, is not forbidden now, and that it is lawful now to keep such Ceremonies. He saith indeed, <hi>pag.</hi> 91. <hi>The Law of Tithes is not now necessary as it was Ceremonious.</hi> And so say I too; and so <hi>Origen</hi> supposes, and yet he and the Primitive Christians thought it was a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern for them to imitate as to the proportion, that they should not give less. And since that was the thing I asserted, it is very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent for <hi>T. E.</hi> to bring any Modern Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors against that Assertion, as if <hi>Erasmus</hi> and <hi>Willet</hi> knew the Primitive Christians mind bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than they themselves did; yet even these Authors he hath cited (<hi>Brute</hi> excepted) do not affirm Tithes as they are a <hi>Quota</hi> were Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial; so far are they from saying, Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans might not imitate that proportion, or that the Primitive Christians did ill in doing so. And thus my third Rule stands good.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:200297:70"/>§. 6. PAg. 74. My Fourth Lesson is, <hi>That the Substance of that which was then required, is due still, not only by vertue of that Law, but because there was an inherent Equity in the Thing.</hi> And here he will not allow me to interpret my own meaning, but he will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his own sense upon my words, and thence draw his Inferences. But I think it will be confessed by all impartial men, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law found established, and did not alter in the matter of Tithes, that was the Substance of what was required under that Law. Now it found not only Maintenance, but that Maintenance fixed to a Tenth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; this it altered not, but added Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Appendages to it, and those cease with the Law that added them, leaving the Maintenance in its fixt proportion in the same state it found it, only better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by God's written choice, and a long prescription. Again he suggests, <hi>There is no inherent Equity in a Tenth part, which may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exceed or fall short of the Labourers desert.</hi> I reply, the Opinion and practice of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> who (guided by the Light of natural reason) approved of this as a just and equal part, is a great confirmation of its inherent Equity. Besides, if <hi>T.E.</hi> say it was not equal with respect to the <hi>Levites,</hi> then he charges God with folly and injustice in ratifying that part; if it were equal for them, then it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be too much or too big a part for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:200297:70"/> of a better Covenant; yea, <hi>T. E.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses, these should have a Maintenance that excelled theirs, <hi>pag.</hi> 78. Now though Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Ministers deserve more, yet since they are content with this, <hi>Volenti non fit injuria.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> did and we may abate of our First Rights, and if any think this part too little, who are to pay it (as the Primitive Christians did) they may satisfie their Consciences by volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Oblations; but many men, now a-daies, are in the contrary extreme, yet none of these can say in Reason and Equity, that we deserve a less or worse Maintenance than the <hi>Levites;</hi> and since that was the part under <hi>Melchisedec</hi>'s Priest-hood, 'tis certain what is so derived and so practiced in all Ages, that must be Equal. To be sure <hi>Origen</hi> and St. <hi>Hierom</hi> thought it had an Equity in it, and therefore they would have it stand in force: St. <hi>Hierom</hi> indeed thought it too little, but since Christ advised them that would be perfect, to sell all, and he literally obeyed that precept himself, selling all his own Estate; therefore St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> thought ordinary Christians must come so high as to a Tenth, and the Nobler sort might go higher, and give all, as Christ di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects, <hi>Matth.</hi> xix. 21. <hi>Luke</hi> xiv. 33. And the Quaker shews he understood Scripture as little as human Authors, when he ignorantly asks, <hi>Where there is a Command for Christians to sell all?</hi> But to return to the Tenth part, the Fathers who would have that part obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory to Christians, did believe it grounded upon an Eternal Reason, which Reason ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:200297:71"/> ceasing, the Law so far as it ordered that proportion, must never cease. Now that reason I declared, <hi>pag.</hi> 49. <hi>viz.</hi> That God's Right continues, and his Worship must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and Ministers to perform that Worship must alwaies continue, and these must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be provided for competently: Now the Tenth was by God judged a competent Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for his Ministers; and since he hath Ministers, and those Ministers continue, and both need and deserve as good a competency still, therefore the Reason of the Law so far as it prescribes that fixed proportion which God thought a competency, is Eternal; and so much of the Law as is grounded upon this Reason, is Eternal also. He pretends that Tithes were grounded on a Temporal Reason suitable to the Jewish Polity, <hi>pag.</hi> 76. But I would gladly have him make out that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Reason, and tell us why a tenth part was more suitable to the Jewish Polity than any other part? and why more suitable to that Polity than to any other Polity? and what Reason now ceasing did then, and then only concern Tithes? He asks, <hi>If the Eternal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Tithes hath tyed God to that part only?</hi> ibid. I answer, his approbation of the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that part made him once choose it, and moved him never to revoke it; and yet it is not concerning what God, but what man is tyed to, of which we now discourse; wherefore this Reason tyes man not to give a less part, since the need and desert is as great as ever. God may alter his own Instituions
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:200297:71"/> (and such we reckon Tithes) and if he see the Reason on which they were grounded al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, no doubt he would do it: But when the Reason continues, and no such Revocation clearly appears, men may not alter them. But he Objects, <hi>That the Alienators of Tithes did not believe them of Divine Right by the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Moral Law,</hi> pag. 77. Nor did I ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them so to be, but only by Divine Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, by positive declaration, and a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent indication of God's Will that he would have us give the Tenth to his Ministers. A sufficient Maintenance indeed, I say, is due by the Law of Nature, and so is the giving God some part of his gifts back again, and as Tithes rely and are grounded on these Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, so they are grounded on the Eternal Moral Law; but I never affirmed they were Due by it, because Tithes, the <hi>Quota,</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies maintained by me to be a positive Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation conveyed by Primitive Tradition to <hi>Abraham, &amp;c.</hi> so that the Quaker here mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states the Question. But as to the Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors how they reputed Tithes to be due, <hi>T. E.</hi> will teach us in his First Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 333. <hi>Henry</hi> 8. (saith he) <hi>believed Tithes were due to God and Holy Church,</hi> and <hi>pag.</hi> 334. <hi>His Son</hi> Edw. 6. (he saith) <hi>was of his Fathers Opinion.</hi> Well then they both were of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as I am, <hi>That Tithes were of Divine Right;</hi> but saith <hi>T. E.</hi> they Alienated them: what then? It seems they practiced not according to their Opinion, and can I help that? Must I reconcile all mens Actions to their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples?
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:200297:72"/> My Adversary is of Opinion, no doubt, that Integrity is a Duty by God's Law, yet he ordinarily Acts very contrary to his Opinion, and so did they; but their Opinion was Right, and their practice Wrong, which is all I need say in that matter. As for our paying of Tenths, that is no Alienation, for we pay not any part of our Tithe in Kind to the King, and as the Clergy may dispose of Tithe once paid them for their private use, so for the publick use also, especially when Law and Gratitude for the protection and priviledges the King gives them, oblige them to such a Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. PAg. 78. This Section is spent in fighting with the shadow of his own petty Cavils, such is his Questioning, Whether the Protestant Clergy of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> be that better Evangelical Ministry suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the <hi>Levitical?</hi> A truth owned by all sober Protestants at home and abroad, and questioned only by Quakers and Papists, just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yoked in our penal Laws under one Title of Recusants, as agreeing in several Tenets as well as this. But when the Pope proves his Deputation to be Christs Vicar and only Judge of all Gospel Ministers, or that Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Club at <hi>London</hi>
                  <note n="(f)" place="margin">See <hi>Enthusiasm no Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi> p. 182.</note>, which challenge the same priviledge, clear their Title to it; then, and not before, we will give them a further Account. In the mean time, he grants the Maintenance of the Evangelical Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:200297:72"/> ought to excel the <hi>Levitical,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must not be unfixed nor Arbitrary, as was noted before; Only his boldness in alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scripture must not be passed by, for whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priest-hood <hi>is changed, T. E.</hi> both here and often else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where presumes to say <hi>it is ended,</hi> to infer a cessation of the Office and Maintenance too, when indeed both the Office, and Tithes the Maintenance, continue still, only they are changed, in the taking away what ever was Ceremonial from both, and this is all St. <hi>Paul</hi> warrants him to say, but his bad cause re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired he should alter the Holy Ghosts Sacred Phrase, and substitute another more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his own vile designs. <hi>Pag.</hi> 79. <hi>But,</hi> saith <hi>T. E. all things are to be New under the Gospel;</hi> and for this he cites <hi>Revel.</hi> xxi. 5. what the Ten Commandments, or the Duties of Prayer and Praising God? These are not made new, nor is the reward for these Duties to be made wholly new, only the Ceremonies pared <hi>off from it,</hi> as they are from the Duties. But indeed this place is generally explained of the state after the Resurrection, and if the Quakers will stay till all that is spoken there, <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3, 4. be fulfilled, till there be a New Heaven and a New Earth, then Maintenance will be no longer needful, nor shall we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute for Tithes any more. But while this World remains, and God is to be Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by mortal Ministers with human neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, the Reason of Tithes continue, and so must the Tithes themselves, they suiting all
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:200297:73"/> Priest-hoods, that of <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> of <hi>Levi,</hi> and of Christ's Church also. There was dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between <hi>Melchisedec</hi>'s Priest-hood and that of <hi>Levi</hi>'s, yet no change in the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the same number of a Tenth was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and must be still, though there be difference between this of <hi>Levi</hi> and the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Priest-hood. And this sufficeth for the Lessons.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. PAg. 79. The Quaker who cowardly hid his head while the premises were urged in the first period, and suffered the Reasons quietly to march by; now fiercely falls upon the Conclusion: and because my Positions are barely recited here, impudently brags they were never proved at all. But I know the Reader cannot but discern his disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty, and therefore taking these vile Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods for evidences of his lost Cause, I shall be very brief in my remarks upon these Pages. And <hi>First,</hi> since Tithe is but the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Maintenance to one determinate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and no more but Maintenance fixed; as Tithes are a Maintenance, they are ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Law of Nature, which <hi>T. E.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses, when he saith, <hi>Maintenance is founded upon a principle of natural Justice and Equity,</hi> pag. 62. <hi>it is Moral and grounded upon Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reason,</hi> pag. 75. <hi>Moral and grounded upon the Law of Nature,</hi> pag. 85. But as Tithes are a certain proportion, so I alwaies declare they were grounded upon Primitive Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:200297:73"/> which Revelation was proved better than ever any Quaker proved that which they call Revelations. The parties who are first read to have fixed on this part, being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly inspired and guided by God's Spirit in all their solemn actions, and God record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with approbation, and his imitating it in his own Written Law, with divers other evidences before produced, sufficiently make it clear. And that there is an internal recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in this proportion, must follow from the Wisdom and Justice of the Patriarchs who gave it, from God's own approbation of it, from the consent of all Nations unto it, and from the payment of it in all Ages; So that if the Maintenance be wisely and justly fixed (and he that denies that, must charge the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs and God himself, who directed them and approved their choice, and also both <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> and Christians, who imitated them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, with folly and injustice) then, if this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion be fit and just, it relies upon the same principles, upon which Maintenance did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie while undetermined; there is the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal rectitude in it, the same Eternal reason for it. Nor can I imagine how Maintenance in general unfixed and arbitrary can be an equitable reward for a fixed and certain la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, since both Reason and Natural Justice require a certain reward for a certain work, and that our Wages should not be less when our work is more. This is all need be said to these impertinent Pages, only that he will do well to make sense of his Assertion, that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:200297:74"/> Tithes even under the Law (when God commanded them) did not rely on an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal but an External Rectitude, which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses that God chose a proportion that had no Internal Rectitude, that is (in plain <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>) no real Equity in it. And again, where he tells us, <hi>Tithes are a circumstance of the Quantity of Maintenance,</hi> whereas all other men think They are the Quantity it self. If <hi>T. E.</hi> were for his Maintenance to receive 40 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> out of 400 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and he that were to pay it should give him but 20 <hi>l.</hi> and tell him the fixed proportion was but a circumstance of the Quantity of his Maintenance; I doubt it would prove such a circumstance, as he would count Essential, and think his Maintenance it self substantially impaired thereby. <hi>Pag.</hi> 84. To return to the Question, I granted in my 50 <hi>pag.</hi> that the giving Tithes by the Patriarchs, before the Ceremonial Law, would not absolutely and alone prove Tithes were not Ceremonial, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some things done by the Patriarchs then, were Ceremonial, I gave Circumcision and the Bloody Sacrifices for my Instances, but shewed withal the vast difference between those and Tithes: Circumcision having no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation at all to the Law of Nature, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal rectitude in it nor eternal reason for its continuance, being only an instituted Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Ceremony, and expresly <hi>in Terminis</hi> repealed in the New Testament, <hi>Acts</hi> xv. 24. <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 2. Bloody Sacrifices also being meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly instituted as Types of Christ to come, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:200297:74"/> such Types they could no longer be, when he was once offered, no more than we can fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell a thing past; and these also in plain words repealed in the New Testament, <hi>Heb.</hi> ix, and x. Hence we conclude, these are purely Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial. But Tithes are like neither of these, being grounded on an equitable and lasting foundation, and not at all expresly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed in the New Testament, nor Types of Christ to come; therefore they are not purely Ceremonial. <hi>T. E.</hi> hath another Instance elsewhere of the distinction of clean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Beasts before the Law, which was not a Ceremonial but a Natural distinction, as the best Interpreters agree, both Jews and Christians<note n="(g)" place="margin">Videtur haec distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio fuisse in lege Naturae. <hi>Tyrin.</hi> in <hi>Genes.</hi> Discrimen erat secundum Naturam eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum. <hi>R.

                  </note>, and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in the very place cited by <hi>T. E.</hi> affirms the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction as <hi>Ceremonial</hi> was first made by <hi>Moses</hi> Law. But however if we grant it Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial, it is expresly repealed in the New Testament, <hi>Rom.</hi> xiv. 14. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so are not Tithes, and therefore not of the same Nature. And we do again affirm it as a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rule, That whatever was practiced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law, enjoyned by the Law, and not expresly repealed under the Gospel, that is not purely Ceremonial: But Tithes were of this Nature, <hi>Ergo,</hi> They are not purely Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial. But he Objects, <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> l. 1. ord. 8. <hi>gives Tenths for an instance of sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows contained in the Law, making them equal
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:200297:75"/> with Circumcision.</hi> It would puzzle his <hi>wise Citator</hi> to find this place thus quoted out of an Author which probably he never saw. But with much pains, I have found it out; and <hi>T. E</hi>'s mistake also: For <hi>Epiphanius</hi> is speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of those things which the Law taught the Jews, both Moral and Ceremonial things, <hi>It taught them</hi> (saith he) <hi>to be circumcised, to keep the Sabbath, to Tithe all that was produced among them, and all that was born of Man and Beast, to give First-Fruits, a Fiftieth or Thirtieth part, To believe in God alone, and to serve him.</hi> Thus far <hi>Epiphanius.</hi> Now are all these sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows? Is to keep the Sabbath a shadow? Or however, is to believe in God alone and serve him, a Ceremony? Yet these are ranked with Circumcision as well as Tithes. The things here ranked are of Different Natures; some wholly Ceremonial, as Circumcision; some partly moral, and partly (as then observed) Ceremonial, as the Sabbath, Tithes and First-Fruits; some only Moral, as Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and therefore <hi>T. E.</hi> imposes a false sense, and draws an unjust inference from these words. <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> also as <hi>T. E.</hi> cites him, <hi>pag.</hi> 88. speaks of Tithes as paid with First-Fruits, and part of the Sacrifices to the Jewish Priest-hood, and so I grant they were Ceremonial as to the manner of paying them then: otherwise to reckon Tithes with bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Sacrifices, is very incongruous, unless the one do as clearly Typifie Christ, and be as plainly repealed as the other, And though they should be any where put together, they
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:200297:75"/> are not alike in their Nature for all that; which shews the Fallacy of his Reply to my Instance out of <hi>Malachy,</hi> where he notes Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are joined with Tithes, <hi>Mal.</hi> iii. 10. And yet he himself, out of <hi>Selden,</hi> grants in his 165 Page, <hi>That some kind of Offerings were in use among the Christians.</hi> And <hi>Irenaeus</hi> saith, <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings in general are not rejected; there were Offerings there, and there are Offerings here, only the kind is changed.</hi> l. 4. c. 34. p. 362. Yea we read of some sort of Offerings yet required, <hi>Rom.</hi> xii. 1. <hi>Phil.</hi> iv. 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> xiii. 15, and 16. <hi>Acts</hi> iv. 34, 35. Offerings therefore, as far as they are Typical and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial, are ceased, and so are Tithes, and no further. So also <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s care of Tithes was <hi>bonum in se,</hi> a good Deed [<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>] he calls it, a word never used for the observance of Ceremonies, which the Prophet calls, <hi>Statutes that were not good, Ezek.</hi> xx. 25. that is, not in their own Nature, nor morally good: but his care of Tithes, and of Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting servile works on the Day of God's pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Worship were both of them really and morally good Works: and I may ask whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this man with a Name dare say, nothing was Moral that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> took care of?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 86, 87. His silence confesses, That Tithes are not reckoned up in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament among things purely Ceremonial, neither are they repealed there, as I shall shew presently (upon <hi>pag.</hi> 94. where he insists up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it again) when I have first examined his
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:200297:76"/> Authorities brought to prove them Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial. Which are so very few (only one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a space of 1500 years) if they did speak to his purpose, that to colour over the matter, he pretends, <hi>That those who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Books</hi> (better, you must suppose, than he is) <hi>cannot reasonably doubt that men of note in several Ages reputed Tithes Ceremonial.</hi> I answer, had he or his Quakers been acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Books, he would not, nor durst not have affirmed so horrible a Falshood. For not one man of Note, before these last Ages did ever so repute the Tithes paid to Gospel Ministers (of which we are now Disputing). And since Tithes were so certainly paid, and so often affirmed to be due within the first 500 years; 'tis very strange if they had been thought Ceremonial by any men of Note; those Noted men did not reprove the Doctors and the People for bringing an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished Ceremony into the Church, since all men of Note do so fully dispute against the restoring of those that were really abolished Ceremonies. Their silence (who do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly write for Tithes) argues they count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them not Ceremonial: How many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons are there against other Jewish Rites? <hi>Can. Apost.</hi> 69. <hi>&amp;</hi> 70. <hi>Concil.</hi> Laodicen. <hi>Can.</hi> 29, 37, 38. <hi>Concil. in</hi> Trullo. <hi>Can.</hi> xi, &amp;c. yet not one against Tithes: Wherefore I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the Quakers that <hi>T. E.</hi> hath brought all the men of Note he had for old time, and this all, is but one; yet neither doth he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert what Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> and <hi>T. E.</hi> would have
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:200297:76"/> him, <hi>viz.</hi> That Tithes are Ceremonial: for <hi>Epiphanius</hi> is not speaking of Tithes as they are or were paid to the Ministers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, but of Tithes, as prescribed in <hi>Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,</hi> and paid to the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priests as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the words before the sentence which <hi>T. E.</hi> had out of <hi>Selden, When</hi> Moses <hi>the Law-giver had finished the Law which God gave him to promulgate in the last Book of</hi> Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, <hi>he puts all the Curses which concern not only the Passover, but Circumcision, Tithing and Offerings, therefore if they avoid one Curse, they fall into many,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>T. E.</hi> cites it. Now those Curses were annexed, not properly to omitting Tithes, but to the not paying them in the manner appointed in <hi>Moses</hi> Law. And if a Jew had paid a Tenth, and yet not with the Ceremonial Appendages, he had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len under the Curse, which is the very Case of the <hi>Tessarescaidecatitae,</hi> whom <hi>Epiphanius</hi> disputes against there, not for keeping a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Feast (for the Church of Christ, he said, did so) but for keeping it at the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in <hi>Moses</hi> Law, <hi>viz.</hi> the Fourteenth day of the Month, and for pretending they should incurr the Curse of the Law, if they did not observe this Ceremonial Appendix of the Paschal Feast: Wherefore he rightly tells them if that Curse were in force, it would oblige them not only to keep the Passover with the Ceremonial Appendage; but to do all other things with their Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Appendages required in that Law; and that the doing one thing in the Jewish manner
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:200297:77"/> would not free them from the Curse, unless they did all else so, that were there required, grounding his Argument upon, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxvii. 26. and <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 10. And since these <hi>Tessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rescaidecatitae</hi> did all else in the Christian man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner (as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> confesses) therefore it is the Manner of doing these as the Jews did, which he disputes against as Ceremonial and abolished, not the Things themselves. The Church kept a Paschal Feast, he condemns not that for Ceremonial. The Church offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he condemns not that for Ceremonial; but doing these in the Jewish manner he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns as Ceremonial. Besides, others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly say the Church gave Tithes then, and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> confesses, they gave First-Fruits, <hi>pag.</hi> 476. and if these men did all else as the Church then did, then 'tis likely they gave Tithes and First-Fruits, but not in the Jewish manner, for according to <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 'tis not Tithes are Ceremonial, but the Jewish manner of paying of them; yea he wonders if they thought that Curse in force, why they did not offer at <hi>Jurusalem,</hi> why they did not take a Lamb the Tenth day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is, why they did not do all in a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial manner? And <hi>T.E.</hi> may as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>Epiphanius</hi> thought the Gospel way of keeping a Paschal Feast, or of Offering, to be Ceremonial, as the Gospel way of paying Tithes: for no more can be inferred from this passage, than that the Jewish manner of paying Tithes was Ceremonial, which we alwaies have acknowledged. And that is all
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:200297:77"/> that I can discern in <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> (as I noted before) who evidently alludes to the Jewish Priests, who in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Phrase, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. <hi>Serve at the Altar, and live by the Altar.</hi> Now the Tithes which these received after the <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> manner were Ceremonial. But I need not much regard his Opinion, who is but a late Author, dying <hi>Anno</hi> 1531. and we have divers others of as great Name both Foreign and Domestick to weigh down a better Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority than his (as shall presently be shewed). As for <hi>Brute,</hi> every Quotation gives new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of his gross ignorance, and in this he thinks Tithes were ordained to reward the Priests for the labour about Sacrifices, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Sacrifices themselves richly paid them for that trouble, and the Priests who offered Sacrifice had no Tithes at all of the people, as even my Adversary observes, <hi>pag.</hi> 35. Again, this <hi>Brute</hi> asks, why First-Fruits were not demanded of Christians, when as they were a voluntary Offering not demanded of the Jews? And if he thought Christians did not offer First-Fruits, he must needs be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant of the state of things in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church. Indeed he poorly begs the Question, and except his own asserting Tithes are Ceremonial, gives not one Reason to prove it; so that to differ from him and his illiterate Fellows in this perswasion, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant</hi> Fryars (see <hi>Selden,</hi> chap. 7. p. 167.) is the way generally to be in the Right. As for his <hi>Bohemians,</hi> 'tis like, their reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on began in Sacriledge, and this Opinion was
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:200297:78"/>
                  <hi>Dignum patellae operculum,</hi> a good Skonce for their covetous spoiling their Clergy of their Revenues. But that we may see the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Learned and sober Reformed Divines, I shall select a few instances, <hi>Gualterus.</hi> A Learned <hi>Tigurine</hi> Divine, professedly disputes against the Opinion of Tithes benig Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, and answers the Arguments brought for it, in his Commentary on <hi>Matth.</hi> xxiii. and concludes, <hi>Tithes ought to be transferred to the Church of the New Testament: for though the</hi> Levitical <hi>Priest-hood be abolished, and the legal Ceremonies are ceased, yet there remains a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of the Gospel.</hi> Gualt. <hi>Comment. in</hi> Matth. xxiii. Another Learned <hi>German</hi> Doctor saith, <hi>Tithes are part of that stipend, which is due to Ministers for the Labours of their Office by the Divine and Natural Law.</hi> Zepper. <hi>de leg. Mos. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 40. <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited into <hi>England,</hi> joyned with Arch-bishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> in that Reformation of Ecclesiastical Laws, which was begun under King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and polished under King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth: and therein is one Title of Tithes, and nineteen Chapters concerning the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them in this Nation, which shews he did not account them abolished or Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial; yea in his <hi>Common Places,</hi> he saith, <hi>The payment of Tithes, since Christ came, is not a Ceremony any longer—for our Ministers now receive Tithes; but by what Law? verily not by the Ceremonial but the Moral Law.</hi> de Civ. Eccl. pot. §. 38. The Learned <hi>Bullenger</hi> also is of our Opinion, for he saith, <hi>They are Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:200297:78"/> who either not pay at all, or not fully, the Goods due to the Church, as Tithes and other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues</hi>— and a little after, <hi>The Clergy may possess these by as good right as any man doth the profits of a Field he hath Tilled.</hi> Bull. decad. 3. Ser. 1. The Great <hi>Chemnitius</hi> also saith, <hi>Tithes as they contain somewhat Moral —are not taken away; wherefore pious Emperours when they became Christians, in their Religious care— gave Tithes, rather than any other Revenues, that so they might imitate God—therefore the people are to be admonished to pay Tithes faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</hi> Chem. <hi>Harm.

And the Jesuits agree with the Quakers in denying Tithes to be due by the positive Law of God. But is it not a strange impudence in <hi>T. E. pag.</hi> 291. to say, <hi>It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that</hi> Fulk <hi>accounted Tithes a part of the Ceremonial Law abrogated by Christ?</hi> and in the next line to affirm, <hi>He thought they might be
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:200297:79"/> retained.</hi> As if the Doctor were so stupid as to maintain, we may retain that which Christ hath abrogated. Did ever any Protestant think we might retain Circumcision, or bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Sacrifices which Christ hath abolished, and which <hi>T. E.</hi> ever ranks with Tithes? Hath not the Quaker spoiled his own Cause by bringing his pretended Witness, saying, <hi>They may be retained.</hi> Since that assures us, he thought them neither Ceremonial nor abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated. And so do the rest of his words cited by <hi>T. E.</hi> For <hi>Fulk</hi> saith, <hi>The payment of Tithes, as it was a Ceremonial Duty, is abrogated with other Ceremonies.</hi> Which is no more than I say, <hi>viz.</hi> that so far as Tithes were Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, so far as the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law had superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced new Modes in the paying them; so far they are abrogated: <hi>But as it is</hi> (saith <hi>Fulk</hi> in <hi>T. E.) a necessary Maintenance, it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</hi> It seems then he accounts Tithes as now paid, a necessary maintenance, or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever such as may be retained, which no abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated Ceremony may: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Doctor is no witness for the Quaker, but Testifies for me in this point, that Tithes, as they are a Maintenance for the Ministers of the Gospel, are not abrogated, nor Ceremonial.</p>

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 91. How he abused his other witness Dr. <hi>Willet,</hi> in leaving out his words, I shewed in the Introduction, and now will observe, that he hath as basely perverted his sense, for <hi>Willet</hi> only saith <hi>Fulk</hi> did before, that <hi>The Law of Tenths is not necessary now as it was Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and confesses that it is lawful to keep that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:200297:79"/> or any other constitution:</hi> So that he did not think Tithes abrogated or Ceremonial, and is no witness for <hi>T. E.</hi> in this Case; yea he proves the Quaker a manifest Lyar in saying, <hi>He plainly calls the Law of Tithes, Ceremonial.</hi> T. E. <hi>p.</hi> 91. for he neither calls it so, nor counts it so, but <hi>a Judicial and Politick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of that Country, neither binding us, nor forbidden to us, but left indifferent:</hi> as the Quaker himself (to his own confusion) cites him in the next Page. And was <hi>Willet</hi> so absurd to say, an Abrogated Ceremonial Law was left indifferent, and was capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing established by Christian Magistrates? 'Tis plain, his private Opinion was, that Tithes were a Judicial Command under <hi>Moses,</hi> with some Ceremonies annexed; which Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies being pared off, the Tithes themselves might well be appointed for a maintenance to Ministers of the Gospel. And to manifest the abuse <hi>T. E.</hi> hath put upon the Doctor, let the Reader consult him in his <hi>Synopsis Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pismi,</hi> p. 313. and he will find that where <hi>T. E.</hi> breaks off after these words <hi>[—were bound to pay Tithes]</hi> The Doctor goes on and shews, <hi>How far forth he held Tithes grounded upon God's Law;</hi> giving divers reasons why they ought to be esteemed so grounded. And <hi>pag.</hi> 311. he saith, <hi>It is agreed, that Tithes are only due to the Church, and cannot be alienated to any other use, nor turned to the use of any Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> And again, out of the Council of <hi>Cabilon, c.</hi> 18. he affirms, <hi>That to with-hold Tithes is no small sin, and deserveth Excommunication,</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:200297:80"/> p. 312. and <hi>ibid. The Tenth is God's part, and by him it is assigned to his faithful Ministers;</hi> yea he affirms, <hi>Tithes are a due Debt, and so no Alms:</hi> Wherefore I conclude <hi>T. E.</hi> hath falsly pretended to this witness also; nor hath he any but his fellow <hi>Brute</hi> to joyn with him in this false and foolish Assertion, <hi>That Tithes are Ceremonial.</hi> But on the contrary, our greatest and best Learned <hi>English</hi> Divines alwaies maintained, that Tithes were Due to the Gospel Ministers <hi>Jure Divino.</hi> That our Holy Martyrs <hi>Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer, Hooper, Taylor, Bradford,</hi> &amp;c. received Tithes, and counted them a maintenance due to Gospel Ministers, is most evident, and <hi>T. E.</hi> dares not deny it. And indeed the words of the Statute in King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixths daies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to by all the Bishops, shew they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved them due to God and Holy Church; and that famous Book of the Reformation of Ecclesiastical Laws, begun by Bishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and perfected afterwards by 32 of the Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentest Divines and Lawyers of <hi>England,</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently shews, that our admirable Reformers were of this Opinion. <hi>Edwyn Sandys,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>York,</hi> saith, <hi>They who take away Tithes, spoil God.</hi> Serm. on <hi>Matth.</hi> xxi. 12, 13.

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 93, 94. After all other Authorities <hi>T. E.</hi> brings his own, and spends a whole Page in vying credit with me, and by his bare <hi>[say I]</hi> confutes my <hi>[says he];</hi> but if he be at leisure to play the Fool, so am not I, who never desired my own word to be taken, but where I give just reasons for it. We proceed therefore to his so much and so often brag'd of Repeal, <hi>viz. Heb.</hi> vii. 12. <hi>pag.</hi> 95. And yet <hi>pag.</hi> 124. he only asks, <hi>If this may not be called a Repeal of Tithes?</hi> And a little after, all he can say of it is, <hi>There is enough said here, to warrant a conclusion, That Tithes are ended; though the word</hi> Repeal <hi>be not used:</hi> So that 'tis plain, and yet admits of a Question, 'tis express, and yet the word not expressed, and the thing can but be deduced (even in <hi>T. E's</hi> own Opinion) by way of consequence. And 'tis like he doubts there is no express Repeal, which makes him labour by so many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove there is no need of one. <hi>First</hi> (he saies) <hi>because the Right I insist on, antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the</hi> Levitical <hi>Law, was not grounded on an Express Command.</hi> But 'tis grounded upon plain Evidence, that the Tenth was that part which God would have given to his Priest, and to the maintenance of his House, and that God approved of and was pleased with that part, yea that God directed his inspired Servants to the choice of that and no other: And therefore cannot be revoked, but upon
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:200297:81"/> as plain evidence that God's Will is not to have that part now, that he now disapproves of it and rejects it, and hath directed his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to the disowning of that, and the choice of some other part. Besides, Sacrifices were instituted at first without any express Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and yet the Holy Ghost thought fit to leave an express Repeal for them; although Sacrifices were so immediate a Type of Christ's sufferings, that it would have been much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier to have known God's intent to have them abrogated without any express Repeal, than Tithes, which are but that maintenance wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and by God's Direction fixed; which maintenance is in it self moral and due by the Law of Nature: for who could suspect, that a Number or a determinate Quantity of that which our Adversary saith was due by the Law of Nature, a Number that never Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied any thing under the Gospel; a Number so early fixed on, so Universally, and so long approved by God and all mankind, should be abrogated without an Express Repeal? <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> He alledges, <hi>The Assignation under the</hi> Levitical <hi>Law was only to the Priests for the time being.</hi> True, but the Right was declared to be God's before that Assignation, and being assigned to them, because they were then God's only Ministers, meerly with respect to their Office, when they cease to be his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, reason will tell us, that since another and a different Priest-hood had the Tenth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Levi, Jure Officii,</hi> if there be any other Priest-hood after <hi>Levi,</hi> to it they would fall
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:200297:82"/> due, unless there be an Express prohibition. Now the reason continues, God hath Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and those Ministers have Service to do for him still, and necessities to be supplied, and why should not these Ministers have that which alwaies belonged to God's Ministers? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an Express Repeal can satisfie an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced man. Let us therefore examine his pretended Repeal: which is this, <hi>For the Priest-hood being changed, there is made of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, a change also of the Law,</hi> Heb. vii. 12. Now Tithes are not once named here, and therefore this is no express Repeal of Tithes; nay if the word had been here, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> had said— <hi>a change also of the Law of Tithes,</hi> that would not have proved the proportion abrogated, only it might have declared some alteration in the manner of paying them; even as the change of the Priest-hood doth not signifie the abrogation, or ending of the Office, for St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures us there is another Priest-hood now, only the word <hi>[Change]</hi> notes the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were pared off from the Office, and consequently from the Law. And 'tis high insolence in <hi>T. E.</hi> here and elsewhere to alter the Holy Ghosts word, and put in <hi>[Ended]</hi> instead of <hi>[Changed].</hi> The most therefore that can be made of this Text is, that it is a Repeal of what was purely Ceremonial in <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Priest-hood, and <hi>Moses</hi> Law; and <hi>T. E.</hi> most miserably begs the Question he was to prove, <hi>viz.</hi> That Tithes as a fixed proportion, and as paid now to Gospel Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:200297:82"/> were purely Ceremonial, before this Repeal can stand in any stead. At present he can extort no more from it, than that it Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals all that was purely Ceremonial in the <hi>Levitical</hi> Tithes, and all that, I grant, is abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, <hi>viz.</hi> all that was new and superinduced by that Law to the elder Duty of Tithes, not the very part; nor the paying that to such as should be God's Ministers, for St. <hi>Paul</hi> takes it for granted in this very Chapter, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Tithes certainly proves a Priest-hood, and indeed is so far from saying any thing against Tithes (as they were paid before the Law, or were to be under the Gospel) in that Chapter, that he affords many Arguments to prove them Due now, as I shall more fully declare in my next Period. And now we see after this Mountain had Teemed so long with a Repeal, it produces nothing but a ridiculous Mouse: Wherefore Tithes, which were pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed by God's Direction before the Law, continued by his Express approbation under the Law, and never Repealed under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, are not Ceremonial, nor abrogated, and the <hi>Levitical</hi> Ceremonies being laid aside with the Law that superinduced them; we ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally conclude it is the Will of God that very part should be paid to his Ministers still, and if his declared unrepealed Will be a Law to us, Tithes are still due <hi>Jure Divino.</hi>

               <p n="1">§. 1. PAg. 97. In the Entrance of the Third Period under the Gospel, my Adversary grants, <hi>That the Ministers of the Gospel may claim a Maintenance in general,</hi> Jure Divino, <hi>in regard such a Maintenance is Established by Divine Authority.</hi> So that we only differ about the proportion of this Maintenance: and because I proceed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the principles I had proved before, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, the proportion was a Tenth; he calls this <hi>Petitio Principii,</hi> yet never perceives that his own Argument is nothing but supposing his own opinion was right, and so he is really guilty of the fault he falsely charges on me. And truly, this is the great Cheat of his whole Book, to slip my proofs in their proper places, or give frivolous Answers to them; and when he is got at a distance, he confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently avers, I proved nothing, and you must suppose he hath proved all his Assertions: grant him these two Things, and he can answer any thing, or else the poor man is quite undone: his water sticks, and he can go no further. Which unfair dealing having noted, I am willing any judicious person who hath read my Discourses shall Judge whether I have proved the Tenth to be the proportion or no. And thus I proceed to make it out still more clearly: <hi>First,</hi> If a Maintenance be
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:200297:83"/> established, it is not left free and Arbitrary (as <hi>T. E</hi>'s Gospel-maintenance is, <hi>p.</hi> 132, 345.) for so men might choose to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or not so much as would be a mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. What is left so loose can scarce be said to be established. Nor is it easie to conceive how a maintenance can be settled and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished but in some <hi>Quota,</hi> his <hi>Bohemians</hi> esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment being settled, and certain stipends. <hi>Seld.</hi> Hist. cap. 7. <hi>p.</hi> 168. and so are the Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries where popular fury precipitated the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, as <hi>T. E.</hi> grants, <hi>pag.</hi> 65. and to me it seems, if the proportion be not esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, the maintenance is loose, unsettled, &amp; unfixed still: Doubtless therefore Christ's Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing a Maintenance in general, was upon supposition, the proportion was well known &amp; certain before, and so 'twas needless to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force that. 'Tis sure it cannot be a good, nor a certain provision, unless it be insome fixed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and suppose Christ hath not set down in words express in the New Testament, that the Tenth is that proportion; it remains that we enquire what proportion is best pleasing to God, and his Will was sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before (without any Repeal) that the Tenth is that proportion, and neither Old nor New Testament mentions any other part as to this matter, and therefore how can we choose, or why should we think of any other? Will not Christ's Establishment of maintenance in general establish this very part which alwaies was the proportion? Or can any think he would be so careless of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:200297:84"/> as not to settle their maintenance? or so forgetful as not to forbid this part and substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute another, if he had disliked this, and liked another better? Upon which grounds, I conclude, that Christ's Establishing mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance did establish it as to the Quantity in the same proportion it was before. But of this we have more evident proofs, which we shall produce as soon as <hi>T. E.</hi> comes to the point.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. PAg. 100. But in hopes to blunder the Question, and confound the Reader, he carries us into an impertinent Ramble of above twenty Pages together. 1. To perswade us that his Quakers are not to pay us this maintenance. 2. And that Christ hath expresly set down <hi>Meat</hi> and <hi>Drink</hi> for this maintenance. The occasion whereof was briefly this: After <hi>T. E.</hi> had confessed all that my Friend (not insisting then on the Divine Right of Tithes) intended to prove by these Texts in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. and <hi>Gal.</hi> vi. <hi>viz.</hi> That maintenance in general to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Gospel, was just, reasonable, and established by Divine Authority; fearing some further use might be made of those Texts to prove the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of Tithes, and to condemn his Quakers, who give us no sort of maintenance, he labours to perswade us, <hi>First, That the principal scope of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, in those places, is to set out, not what the Maintenance is, but from whom it is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:200297:84"/> The falshood of which pretence I shewed before, but since he Cavils still, and will not recede from so plain an Error, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause 'tis for his advantage, I shall now fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifest it: And whosoever reads the first place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. will see that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal scope of the Apostle is, to assert his own, and the Gospel Ministers Right, to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without working for their Living. And all his Instances, set out the right of a Souldier, Vine-dresser, and Shepherd, to be maintained, his mystical Interpretation of that Precept of the Law, <hi>vers.</hi> 8, 9, 10. is to prove, that God intended to secure his Right; and the excellency of this Employment proves, this Right was reasonable, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. And so doth the Example of others, <hi>vers.</hi> 12. so that his omitting to make use of his just power, ought not to make them think he was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested with it, since he had a peculiar reason then for not exercising it. And then he comes to the Two Verses mainly insisted on, <hi>vers.</hi> 13, 14. wherein he shews what the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance is, that he had this Right to, by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelling it with the maintenance under the Law, and asserting that Christ had taken like Care under the Gospel; and to assure us he was speaking of the things by which Gospel Ministers were to be maintained, he goes on, <hi>vers.</hi> 15. <hi>But I have used none of these things.</hi> Little or nothing here of the people who were to pay this, and what is said of them is but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental, and as it is necessarily connected to the business of his Right who is to receive it.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:200297:85"/> And in the two principal Verses, not one word of the People; but as <hi>Theophylact</hi>-notes, the Apostles Phrase purposely sets aside those who paid it, <hi>For,</hi> he saith, <hi>not the Jewish Priests take it of the Offerers, but they partake of the Altar—in like manner he doth not say, the Lord hath ordained they shall live of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples—but live of the Gospel, That the givers be not puffed up, for thou dost not maintain him</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>but his work,</hi> viz. <hi>the Gospel.</hi> Theophyl. <hi>in loc.</hi> And the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor saith this whole Discourse is an Answer to this Objection, <hi>Thou</hi> (say the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to St. <hi>Paul) hast no Right to Maintenance, and therefore thou dost not take it.</hi> id. ibid. <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> also speaking of this very place observes, <hi>That the Scripture saith concerning Ministers, because of their continual employment about the people, and their Ecclesiastical Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,</hi> Who feedeth a Flock and eateth not, <hi>&amp;c. Panar.</hi> l. 3. T. 2. hae. 80. It was therefore the Ministers right, and the nature as well as the equity of their maintenance, which was St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s scope here. As for the peoples duty to give, there was no Question about that, for <hi>They gave to others,</hi> vers. 12. yea 'tis evident St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes no exception nor limitation, but pleads his power and right to receive maintenance from all the Christian Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> although 'tis certain some of them did not receive him, nor like him so well as other Preachers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. yea some followed false Teachers, and yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out distinguishing these from the rest, he
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:200297:85"/> pleads his Right with respect to all professed Christians there: so far was St. <hi>Paul</hi> from thinking the peoples sin in seperating from their Minister duly commissionated, could free them from the Duty of paying mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to him, and so far was he from making that his principal scope as <hi>T. E.</hi> pretends. As for his trick of Printing <hi>[Them</hi> and <hi>Their, You</hi> and <hi>Ye]</hi> in great Letters to colour his fallacy, 'tis a poor shift, and if I should Print the words <hi>[I, we, mine, my]</hi> in such a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, it would easily remove that device, vers. 1. <hi>Am [I] not free?</hi> vers. 2. <hi>If [I] be not an Apostle to others, yet doubtless [I] am to you; for the Seal of [mine] Apostleship are ye,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>vers.</hi> 3. <hi>[Mine] answer to them that examine [me] is this,</hi> vers. 4. <hi>Have [we] not power,</hi> &amp;c. But I am not at leisure to trifle, and 'tis not words but sense I consider.</p>

He Cavils still about the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of a Souldier, a Vine-dresser, a Shepherd and an Ox: but let him answer one Question; Did St. <hi>Paul</hi> compare the people to these, or the Ministers? If the Ministers, 'tis plain, he is making out their Right. And let it be observed, that though the people be defended by the Souldier, and his pay is raised often from their Labours, yet they are not properly said to set him on work, nor to maintain him; his Prince Lists and paies him, and he is his Servant, not the Peoples Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; nor can the Vine or Flock, though they
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:200297:86"/> feed those that look to them, be accounted the Masters of their respective Guardians. But the great Husbandman who (in this comparison) is God, who sets Ministers on work, and is owner of the People, Vines and Flock, and out of his own Rights, the Tenth (due to him in acknowledgment of his bounty in giving the rest) he maintains and paies them: which is rationally made out by the ingenious Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Diatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba <hi>on</hi> 1 Cor. ix. 14.</note>, in his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course on this place. And can it be likely St. <hi>Paul</hi> should speak of the peoples maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Ministers, when indeed they cannot properly be said to maintain them at all, as his very instances do shew? Nor is there any great matter, in what he asserts with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny brags, <hi>pag.</hi> 105. viz. <hi>That it is unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unjust for one man to keep the Ox, while he is treading out Corn for another:</hi> For if his Corn might be trod out with the same Labour, and the only Reason why the Ox did not tread it out, was because the Farmer was so lazy, he would not lay his Corn down, I see no such unreasonableness for the lazy Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman to joyn toward his keeping. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side <hi>T. E.</hi> must beware of this Assertion, which taxes St. <hi>Paul</hi> for an unreasonable and unjust man, who while he trod out the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> Corn, took wages from other Churches for which he could do no Service then, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 8. And 'tis not counted unjust to make a man pay for an Ordinary which was provided for him, though he did not actually eat of it; because he might have come if he pleased.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:200297:86"/> And we pay often for Priviledges, which we never make use of, only because we may use them if we will. As for the other place, <hi>Gal.</hi> vi. 6. <hi>T. E.</hi> denies not, that the Apostle doth there give a Character of the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but (if he may be his own Judge) that is not St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s chief intent. Whereas there is but only the bare mention of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is no more than the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riphrasis of a <hi>Christian,</hi> and came afterwards to be the name of <hi>New Converts,</hi> hence called <hi>Catechumens.</hi> And we may note St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts are there directed to all Christians, as <hi>vers.</hi> 4. <hi>Let every man prove his own work,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>vers.</hi> 9. <hi>Let us not be weary,</hi> that is, (us Christians) so <hi>vers.</hi> 10. <hi>Let us do good to all men,</hi> &amp;c. So that here is no limitation as to the persons giving. But as to the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it self, here is noted, <hi>First,</hi> How it must be given, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, set out, and dispensed, so as the Minister may have his share. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> Who it must be given to, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to him that hath the Office of a Teacher; and <hi>T. E.</hi> may as well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, the Minister must be alwaies actually teaching, from this Phrase <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as that the people must be actually Taught, from the other. Again, what the maintenance is, and whence it must arise, and of what it must consist, is also plainly set down here, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>viz.</hi> some part of all his Goods, not in Money alone, or a <hi>Bohemian</hi> Stipend, but a maintenance in kind, such as Tithes are. And this last being peculiarly
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:200297:87"/> manifested in this place seems to be the main scope of this Text.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. PAg. 106. Yet <hi>T.E.</hi> (who like those old Hereticks, <hi>Facilius vinci possit quam persuaderi</hi>) wrangles still, though only to shew his own obstinancy: For whereas he pretends, <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>would not expect Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from the Proud, the Lazy, and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate:</hi> I answer, that surely he would not exempt professed Christians from obeying one Law of God meerly because they broke ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for so he should have encouraged their sin, by letting them have advantage by it. I am sure he did not think fit then to let people choose Teachers according to their own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, meerly to allay the itch of their conceited ears, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 3. nor yet to run into Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, no not after <hi>Paul, Apollos,</hi> or <hi>Cephas;</hi> nor did he allow them to reject all human Teaching on the Quakers pretence of being taught by Christ immediately, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 12. <hi>Chap.</hi> iii. 14. making this which is now made a sign of being Spiritual, to be an evidence of a carnal man. If they once received Christs Doctrine, they were then to receive such Teachers as his Apostles sent to them, and set over them, and to maintain them Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: and much more ought men to do this, now that the Church is settled and governed in an ordinary way, like other Societies of men. To allow men now to choose or refuse Pastors at their pleasure, is to take away the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:200297:87"/> power of Christian Kings and Bishops, and to reduce all into a wild confusion. And since St. <hi>Paul</hi> so briskly asserted his right even when he would not use it, and claims to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in general, among whom was some as proud and obstinate as our Quakers (despising his Excommunications) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 2, 6, 10. surely he would not exempt any such, under Christian Magistrates, and in a settled Christian Church. And whereas he pretends, <hi>If all such should be drawn in to maintain Gospel Ministers, the Heathens would not be exempted.</hi> That is a poor fallacy, since the <hi>[all such]</hi> that I am speaking of, are Proud, Lazy, and Obstinate Christians; so that <hi>T. E</hi>'s wise Consequence is, That if Proud, Lazy, and Obstinate professed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians must maintain Ministers; then Proud, Lazy, and Obstinate Heathens must do so too: and because Subjects must obey, Aliens must obey also; but I hate to dwell upon those his impertinencies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 108. 'Tis <hi>T.E</hi>'s Character of a Knave, to pervert the Apostles sense to uphold a selfish Interest, and I doubt he will be found guilty of so doing in his pair of Inferences, which he saies are all that can be inferred from these Instances: His <hi>First</hi> is, <hi>That a Gospel Minister may expect and receive a Maintenance from such as receive his Ministry.</hi> His <hi>Second, That he ought not to expect any Maintenance from them that do not receive his Ministry.</hi> And is this all? Many other things we have shewed may
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:200297:88"/> be inferred from these Instances, and more we shall shew; and since there is nothing in either of these Texts, importing any power in the people to receive, or not receive their Minister and his Ministry; these are not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inferred from hence, but imposed upon the Apostle to uphold the Quakers Interest, and justifie their Faction and Injustice, who do <hi>First,</hi> assume to themselves a power to allow or disallow, receive or reject their Lawful Minister. <hi>Secondly,</hi> And on pretence of such rejecting, unjustly detain his Dues. 'Tis these Two darling Tenets have bred this long Digression; but I affirm they are as false, as they are pernicious; the ground of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing absolutely destructive of all sort of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Civil and Ecclesiastical, Military and Domestick; and the certain and speedy way to bring a Kingdom or a Church, an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, yea a Family it self to confusion and ruin: for if the people may reject their Prince, he Reigns at the mercy of every <hi>Demagogue</hi> that can but pretend dislike enough to draw in a party, and then Rebellion is no sin. And if the Hearers may reject those that are over them in the Lord, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> v. 12. Then the Church must be divided without remedy; and Schism (which Scripture condemns) is no crime. No Army can be preserved, or conducted, if the Souldiers may disobey their Commanders, upon pretence they do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or approve of them: No Family can subsist, if the Servants and Children may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themselves from their Duty by reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:200297:88"/> their Master or their Parents. This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed principle vindicates those Rebels in the Gospel, who sent their King word, <hi>He should not Rule over them,</hi> Luke 19.14. This prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple turns the Heels of Government up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and makes those who are Governed to become Governours; it would extirpate all Societies from among men, and reduce us to Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> his imaginary state of Nature; for if they may reject those who are over them in Spirituals, they may by the same pretence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject those who are over them in Temporals, and Level all at last: So that the Government where such principles are taught &amp; embraced, is bound in its own defence to suppress the abettors of them: Especially because <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> They infer, that upon this rejecting they are discharged from paying of those Dues, which are the support of their Civil or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Superiours, upon which ground they may deny Tribute to the Prince, as well as Tithes to a Priest; and a man by his own stubbornness, may free himself from all his obligations of rendering what is due by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine or Human Laws to any sort of Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; which is absurd, and an Inference, that no sort of men but Quakers make. For the Primitive Christians approved not the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor the manners of the Heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, yet they paid them Tribute. The <hi>French</hi> Protestants do not approve of their Popish Ministers, nor partake of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, and yet they pay them their Tithes.

If <hi>T.E.</hi> should pretend this was not his sense of <hi>[Receiving our Ministry]</hi> this Period will assure us it was, wherein he fallaciously supposes our case in a settled Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, to be the same with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles in their first Mission to the Jews who had not heard of the Gospel before: as if because those Jews were not obliged to maintain the Disciples till they had received the Christian Doctrine, therefore now such as profess themselves Christians and subjects to a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Prince, were at liberty to own or not to own the Ministers which their Prince and the Laws set over them; and by not owning them, were exempted from the maintenance assigned them by the Laws of God and the King; which is to reduce us to exchange our Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for Fig-leaves, and our Houses for <hi>Adam</hi>'s shady Bowers, and to oblige us to do that out of choice which they did out of necessity, yea to throw away our conveniencies meerly to imitate those who could not procure them. The Apostles were first to make men receive the Gospel, and then to expect maintenance. We live with these who have owned themselves ro receive the Gospel, and so are obliged to maintain the Ministers of the Gospel: and since they live in a Country where Fiocks are divided, and particular Shepherds set over the several Flocks, the Sheep must not now pretend a liberty to choose their Shepherd, nor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse those and with-hold maintenance from
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:200297:89"/> them who by just Authority are Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to feed and watch over them: Every single Minister is contented with the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance allotted him from his own Flock; no particular Sheepheard pretends to expect a Maintenance from all Christians, nor did I mean any thing more, than that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in a setled Church, must belong to some Flock or other, and so give Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to their proper Pastor; all must give it to some or other, which Duty they are not to exempt themselves from, on pretence that they (who are private persons.) own not their allotted Sheepheard, but have chosen themselves another who brings no Commission from Lawful Authority to prove his Right or Office in an Ordinary way, nor no Miracles to prove he is immediately called and sent by God; and yet is admitted for a Speaker among the Quakers.</p>

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:200297:90"/> put only concerning Christians, converted and professing themselves such; He miserably shifts us off with this poor pretence, that unconverted <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> needed a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry to convert them; but this is nothing to the purpose, wherefore He trys another way, <hi>viz.</hi> That such as were converted needed a Ministry to build them up, exhort and excite them; but <hi>this is no more than to explain and apply that which they know already:</hi> Which <hi>T.E.</hi> will not allow to be a work sufficient for us Priests to claim Maintenance for, see his first Book. <hi>pag.</hi> 216. 235. 268. and again here <hi>pag.</hi> 375. yet at this pinch he is forced to confess, it was all the Gospel-Ministry had to do for converted Christians in the Apostles days: So that he is glad to make use of that Position to serve his own turn, which he had derided his Adversary for before. As for the assurance he gives me that the Quakers have no need of our Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that only signifies they are wise in their own Conceits, for it is generally observed, there are not so ignorant a sort of Men in the whole Kingdom as the Quakers generally are: One of which Sect went about to prove to me that Women spoke in the Apostles days, because it was written; <hi>that</hi> Lydia <hi>ministred unto the Apostles,</hi> that is saith he, <hi>She spake the word unto them:</hi> Another put on Sackcloth and carried Boughs of an <hi>Ash</hi> Tree in his hand, and being demanded the reason said; <hi>The Lords Messengers were to come in Sackcloth and Ashes.</hi> I profess I have met
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:200297:90"/> with many of them who did not know the first Principles of Christianity, and yet these thought they needed no Teaching, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lass they had need to be taught their own Ignorance first, and then no doubt they would perceive we were able to Teach them all things necessary to Salvation; and since we are ready and willing to do this, we may as justly require Maintenance from them, as the Physician his Fee from that distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pred Patient who in his Feavorish frenzy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares he needs none of his Medicines, and not the sick Man, but the By-standers; (such as the King and his Judges) are fittest to end the controversy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 113. And whereas the Quakers wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully neglect that instruction we are ready to give them, their cause is rightly paralleld by the Truant Boys in an endowed free School, which must not take off from the Masters Maintenance, nor doth <hi>T. E.</hi> answer this, by saying <hi>this Maintenance of the Master is not from the Boys;</hi> for I have proved-before, the Ministers Maintenance is not from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it was allotted them by others, who were the right Owners of it, by God whose peculiar right the Tenth is, and by Kings and Princes and the Representatives of the whole Kingdom, whose the Land was at the time of the Endowment; and though the people pay it, yet tis not any part of their own Estate; 'tis a part which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver purchased, nor could it be let by the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:200297:91"/> owner of the Nine Parts, and therefore it is to be accounted a reserved Rent upon all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, as well as the 20<hi>l.</hi> out of the 200 <hi>l. per An.</hi> settled on the Free-School; which 20 <hi>l.</hi> the Tenant pays indeed, but not out of his own, and therefore if he should pretend he did not receive the Master, or had no Boys to be Taught, or having Boys they did not or would not come to School; this could not excuse the Tenant from paying the full 20 <hi>l. per An.</hi> nor would the Master be unjust in receiving it fully and without abatement. But whiles he dislike my paralel, he hath made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; wherein he justly compares the Quakers to Boys, that find their Master un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable and teaching false Latin: fit Judges! yet ordinarily a School-boy is as fit to Judge his Master, and as likely to find his real inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, as the Quakers to judge of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters: <hi>T. E.</hi> perhaps may be one of those School-Masters whom an ingenious School-Boy would detect, but tis rate that men of his proficiency dare venture to teach beyond the <hi>Accidence;</hi> and therefore the Law doth not provide for what happens so very sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: But in other causes, the Souldior must have his pay, and they also must pay their proportion of it, who hold all War to be unlawful under the Gospel; and they who say they need none of the Souldiors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, they will defend themselves. The Lawyer hath his Fee though he never plead, even when the Cause is ended by Arbitrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Clergy have a far better Title to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:200297:91"/> their Dues than any of these, whose Title is, meerly by humane Law or Voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. Besides if wilful neglect or not own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Ministry would discharge Men, then to turn Papists, Atheists, or to spend the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day in Drinking would be as fair a way to discharge Men of Tithes, as to turn Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; and so men would be hired to turn Sectaries, Debauchees, Papists or Atheists with the abatement of Gods and the Priests Portion, and is this to be tolerated or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured in a setled Church? And why might not a Papist stop his Tithes upon these very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences? yet they do very freely and fully pay them to us in obedience to tho Laws of the Land, though they do not own our Ministry, nor at all partake of it.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. PAg. 115. The second Evasion that <hi>T.E.</hi> hath to avoyd the force of these Texts, is that Christ himself hath expresly set down what this Gospel Maintenance is, and he supposes it to be Meat and Drink: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he could not answer my Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this; he loudly exclaims against a pretended wrong done him, in my saying he affirmed, <hi>That the same Authority had first e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished a Maintenance only in general, and then had particularly exprest what it should be:</hi> charging me with putting in the words [on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and particularly] whereas the whole stress of his. Argument in his 284. 285. and 286. pages leans upon this supposition, that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:200297:92"/> Christ had established only a Maintenance in general, and it is Sense rather than Words I aim at; and yet his very words are <hi>pag.</hi> 319. <hi>He that appointed a Maintenance in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, described also that Maintenance in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular:</hi> So that I do not add the word [par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular] but he is glad to deny his own words to palliate his bafled cause, and since he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses <hi>pag.</hi> 116. of this Book, that he did say, <hi>the Maintenance was expresly set down by Christ;</hi> is not that the same with particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly expressing it? for can any thing be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly set down, and not be particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed? Wherefore he only catcheth at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occasion to represent me like himself, and to hide his own inability to answer my proofs under these loud and unjust clamours. But to the Point, our Saviour sets down Meat and Drink as sufficient for them to expect from Men, while but yet in turning to the Faith; but St. <hi>Paul</hi> sets down as expresly, a part of all their goods to be given to Ministers by them who were professed Christians. And we must not say St. <hi>Paul</hi> contradicted his Masters order, but consider they spoke in different respects; Christ on a particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion as to the first preaching: And his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle laid down a perpetual rule for a set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Church; yea it is evident, the Apostles did not think Christs rule of Meat and Drink was perpetual or binding to them among pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Christians, because they did frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take more as I proved <hi>pag.</hi> 60. from <hi>Acts</hi> IV. and Chap. 5. and from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> XI. 9.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:200297:92"/>
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> IV. 18. Now it had been as great a transgression of Christs order for the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les to take more than Meat and Drink, as for Christians to give less, if that had been a standing rule; to add, being as great a fault as to diminish from Christs precepts: And though the Believers gave it freely, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles ought not to have let them done it in their own wrong, and in affront to Christ, as if he had allotted too little; for it would have been Superstition at least: But indeed they knew it was Due, and therefore call it Wages, yea and say that carnal things are no great matter in comparison of Spirituals; so that they who give most (in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) do not give so much as the Ministers deserve, nor return so good as they receive. They thought therefore more than Meat and Drink Due, and though more was given freely and voluntarily, that doth not prove it was not Due, any more than our freely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying God, proves that our Obedience is not Due to him. And a man not only may but ought to do his Duty freely and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily; so that this exception signifies nothing: But since <hi>T.E.</hi> will expound Meat and Drink to signify <hi>all the necessary conveniencies of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane life,</hi> thereby he grants that a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster may <hi>jure Divino,</hi> claim all necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of humane Life; and since Tithes in most places will but barely afford them that, in those places (it seems) a Tenth part is due <hi>jure Divino;</hi> where no less part will afford a Minister a good Habitation fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:200297:93"/> with all necessary conveniencies, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Food and Rayment for himself his Wife and Family, to spare something for a provision for his Children after his decease (for I suppose <hi>T. E.</hi> dares not own himself so much a Papist as to deny the Clergy the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Marriage); and thus he hath granted the Question as to the greatest part of the Livings of England: But it is very imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in him to restrain that Text (1. <hi>Tim.</hi> VI. 8. <hi>Having Food and Rayment let us be therewith content</hi>) to Ministers; for St. <hi>Paul</hi> is there speaking to all Christians, as St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> notes saying, <hi>Doth he say this to the Teacher only? no, in no wise, but to all Men.</hi>

We have now at length brought our Rover to the Question, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether Christ have Established Tithes for the maintenance of the Gospel Ministry in the New Testament? to prove which I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued; First, That he did establish them, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard there is no Repeal of Tithes in all the New Testament: see my 61. and 62. pag. which I have made evident before, Chap. 11. §. 8. And that I may not, like the Quaker, tire my Reader with Repetition, I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thither and content my self at present to shew that <hi>Hebr.</hi> VII. the only place he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces for a Repeal of Tithes, is a very good proof they are not repealed; to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose we will first consider that place: Where the Apostle writing to the converted <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> (yet highly opinionated of their <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> Priesthood) and having Digressed from Chap. V. 11. to Chap. VI. 20. returns to his purpose to shew, that there was another and better Priesthood now appointed by God to succeed <hi>Aarons,</hi> even the Priesthood by Christ which was after the order of <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> Ch. VI. 20. And the Apostles Argument is thus laid: He that is a Priest after the order of <hi>Melchisedec</hi> is a greater Priest, than those of <hi>Aarons</hi> order: But Christ is a Priest after the order of <hi>Melchisedec: Ergo.</hi> And First he proves the <hi>Minor;</hi> that Christ is of <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedec</hi>'s order, in this seventh Chapter. First, from the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ment between Christ and <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedec;</hi>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:200297:94"/> who was First, a King and a Priest, and his Priesthood is proved, First, from his Duty [blessing] the proper office of a Priest. Secondly, from his reward [receiving Tithe of all] the proper maintenance of a Priest. His being a King is proved from his Titles, King of Righteousness and King of Peace, ver. 1.2. Thus Christ is like him in Offices and Titles. Secondly, like him in his Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, without Father and Mother. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, like him in duration, no Successor of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recorded; and unlike the Levitical Priests in both respects, who were tyed to a certain Family and had Successors, ver. 3. Thus the <hi>Minor</hi> is proved, <hi>viz.</hi> That Christ is a Priest of <hi>Melchisedec</hi>'s Order, as <hi>David</hi> also asserted Chap. V. 6. Secondly St. <hi>Paul</hi> proves the <hi>Major,</hi> viz. That Christ was of a better Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than <hi>Aaron</hi> or <hi>Levi;</hi> for if <hi>Melchisedec</hi> be greater than <hi>Levi,</hi> then a Priest after his Order is greater than <hi>Levi:</hi> now that <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedec</hi> was greater than <hi>Levi,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> proves, <hi>First,</hi> from his Reward being greater, as to things and persons. First, as to things, he had Tithes also of Spoils, which <hi>Levi</hi> never Tithed, ver. 4. Secondly, as to persons <hi>Levi</hi> had Tithes only of the Jewish people, their Brethren according to the Law, ver. 5. But <hi>Melchisedec</hi> Tithed one whom the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth not mention to be of his Kindred, and of one greater than any that the Levitical Priesthood Tithed. <hi>Secondly,</hi> he proves <hi>Melchisedec</hi> greater from his Duty, <hi>viz.</hi> of Blessing, for he blessed one greater than <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi,</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:200297:94"/> and that proves him greater, ver. 6.7. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He proves him greater by the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Office and Reward, which is Tithes, they being under <hi>Moses</hi> Polity payd to men that had a changeable Priesthood; but here to an immortal Priesthood, <hi>viz.</hi> To <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> whose death is not Recorded, and in him as a Type to Christ, of whom tis certain he liveth a Priest for ever, <hi>Psal.</hi> CX. 4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He proves him greater in that (as Christ took Tithes in <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> so) <hi>Levi</hi> himself by way of Homage and owning his Subjection, payd Tithe to <hi>Meschisedec</hi> in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Ergo, Melchisedec</hi>'s is a greater Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood than <hi>Aarons</hi> or <hi>Levi,</hi> which he proves. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> because that Priesthood was to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Priesthood of <hi>Levi,</hi> for if <hi>Levi</hi>'s Priesthood had been the greatest, best and most perfect, under which the Ceremonial Law was promulged, then that new Priest (spoken of by <hi>David,</hi>) would have been of that Order; or rather there had been no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sort of Priest predicted: but it was a sign of remission of Sins, and the perfection which follows on it, could not be had by that Law and that Priesthood, since there was not only another Priesthood spoken of, but of another Order, ver. 11. And indeed the Priesthood could not be thus changed to another Order without a change in the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law in that particular, <hi>viz.</hi> as it forbids all other to be Priests but those of the Tribe of <hi>Levi, ver.</hi> 12. But here is a Priest proved of another and better Order who is
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:200297:95"/> of another Tribe, than that appointed by the Ceremonial Law, even of the Tribe of <hi>Juda,</hi> ver. 13.14. And tis clear there was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Priest to arise of another Order, and made not according to the Legal fading Rites, but appointed to continue for ever, ver. 15.16. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Christs Priesthood is better and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than that of <hi>Levi:</hi> Now this being the plain sense of the Apostle, with what face can any man pretend this 12th. verse is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal of Tithes? when if it be compared with the verse before, and the two verses after, it is a Repeal merely of that one Branch of the Levitical Law, which confined the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> (although if it were a Repeal of all the Ceremonial Law, it would not concern Evangelical Tithes payd without any Ceremonies) yet this is all the Bottom <hi>T. E.</hi> hath to set his confidence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But indeed the whole discourse doth confirm Tithes as paid to Gospel Ministers, for Tithes are supposed by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seperable from a Priesthood; so that it is sufficient in the Apostles Opinion to prove <hi>Melchisedec</hi> a Priest, and used by him as a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium to make it out he was so, in that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Tithes, ver. 2. and ver. 8. He uses this Phrase [receiving Tithes] for [being Priests], so that when his Sense is evidently, <hi>Here men that Dye are Priests, but there he is a Priest</hi> &amp;c. He expresses it by, <hi>here men that dye receive Tithes; but there he receiveth them,</hi> &amp;c. So that a Tithe-taker and a Priest are words of the same signification with St. <hi>Paul.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:200297:95"/> he makes a larger extent as to Tithing to prove a greater and better Priesthood, ver. 4.5.6. And he shews that an unchangeable Priesthood, such as that of <hi>Melchisedec</hi> (ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to an unchangeable Law) may receive Tithes, and supposes that Christ himself did in <hi>Melchisedec</hi> as his Type, Tithe <hi>Levi,</hi> and so evidenced the superiority of his Priesthood ver. 8.9.10. Besides when the Apostle had thus appropriated Tithes to <hi>Melchisedecs</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, so as to prove his Priesthood and its su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority thereby; and then shewed that the Levitical Priesthood was now changed into that of <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> it is likely he would have declared Tithes Repealed which <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedec</hi>'s Priesthood, had as well as <hi>Levi</hi>'s? Might not a Jew have replied, you prove and advance <hi>Melchisedec</hi>'s Priesthood by Tithes, only to perswade us that Christ who is of that Order, hath a better Priesthood; but if you also tell us that Tithes are utterly Repealed, and none to be paid to his Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, nor to those he Deputes; Then what is <hi>Melchisedec</hi>'s Tithing to Christs Priesthood? or how is it the same Order if it have not the same Rights? And if we grant that <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedec</hi>'s is better than <hi>Levi</hi>'s in this respect, yet Christs is upon the same account apparently worse. Thus might a Jew have Argued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerably upon <hi>T. E</hi>'s principle and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal of Tithes being repealed. By all this we see the very force of the Apostles Argument lies in supposing Tithes are not repealed, but that they are proper to an unchangeable
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:200297:96"/> Priesthood, yea that Christ Priesthood hath a Right to them, and so will prove due to us in his Right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 125. His Repeal being thus clearly disproved, and shewed to be rather an esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of Tithes as proper to are Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Priesthood; I shall only make some brief reflections on his frivolous pretences in this Section, <hi>First,</hi> when I require an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press revocation of Tithes by Name (which is but his own measure meted back in his 17. 57. and 143. <hi>pages</hi>) He knowing he had no such thing to produce, pretends I cannot find all the Mosaical Ceremonies repealed by Name; I reply, all Ceremonial things obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Patriarchs are repealed by Name, as Sacrifices, Circumcision, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and since Tithes are not so Repealed; tis an evidence they were not Ceremonial; and truly many of the Ceremonies purely Mosaical were so necessarily annexed to that Priesthood, and Temple, and Worship, that they are impract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icable now, and need no express Repeal, there being no need nor occasion for them, nor any possibility of doing them. But as to Gods part, the Tenth of our Substance, this suted the first Priesthood, and sutes that of the Gospel, is needed now, and practicable enough; nor had it any Relation to Christ to come, and so could not be imagined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogated without an express Repeal. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, T. E.</hi> again repeats his former injustice altering the Apostles Words, putting <hi>the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:200297:96"/> Priesthood being ended</hi> instead of <hi>being chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> see him, pag. 124. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> my Rule of <hi>Expressa nocent, no expressa non nocent,</hi> for all his endeavours to pervert it, confirms my as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion; for we have express practice before the Law, express claim first, and then an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press command under the Law, and this hurts my Adversary; but we have no express Repeal under the Gospel, and so nothing to hurt me. But whereas <hi>Fourthly,</hi> he pretends that Christs intention for their continuance is not expressed in the New Testament; I answer, that there is enough said to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant a conclusion; that he intended they should be continued, which he thought suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in his case, <hi>pag.</hi> 124. But withal we cannot find an express Text in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, for every thing Commanded in the Old which Christ intended should be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, as appears in the Case of the Sabbath, the parallel to Tithes; for the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture requires some part of our time to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to God, (as well as some part of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state): the Moral Positive Law fixed the Number and Proportion to be a seventh part, the Ceremonial Law superinduced many Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies to this, but those Christ repealed; only the Proportion he left upon its old firm Principles, and made no New Law about it; yet the Church always believed Christ inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the seventh part of our Time should stand as Dedicate to Almighty God, and so it doth now, and that <hi>Jure Divino;</hi> in the opinion of many of our English Divines, and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:200297:97"/> the same may be alledged for Tithes, for which I come new to produce the Evidences out of the New Testament, which shew that it is Christs Will they should be the Maintenance of his Gospel Ministry.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. PAg. 127. Having thus proved Tithes were not repealed, it follows they stand upon their first Foundation still, and are now due <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> which Term (because it is Ambiguous, and <hi>T. E.</hi> takes occasion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to Cavil,) I will here explain: <hi>Jus Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinum</hi> therefore, is taken in a twofold Sense: primarily and strictly it denotes a thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by a positive precept of God; and in this Sense, setting aside the Articles of the Creed and the Duties of the Moral Law; there be few things (saith a Learned Bishop) that can be said to be of Divine Positive Right under the New Testament.<note n="(c)" place="margin">Bishop <hi>Sanderson</hi> his Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy not prejudiclal Sect. 2. §. 3.</note> But (saith he) there is a secondary and more extended signification of that Term, of frequent use a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Divines, wherein those things which are not expresly and in words commanded in Scripture; yet having their Warrant from the institution of God; or from the example of Christ and his Apostles, and by the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judgment of the Church, have been thought fit to be continued. These things are in a larger Sense said to be <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> and of this sort is reckoned Episcopacy, the observation of the Lords Day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of this sort I always asserted Tithes: So another
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:200297:97"/> of that Venerable Order saith, <hi>Right or Due is taken in a twofold Sense, either as to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular precept, explicitely exacting a Tenth in Terms, as in the Levitical Law; or as to a general Ordinance including, implying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to a Tenth.</hi> And in this<note n="(d)" place="margin">Bishop <hi>Gauden</hi> Ministers Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance pag. 13.</note> second Sense I did before, and do now take <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> in this controversy, not for a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Law expresly naming Tithes in the New Testament, (which I freely granted was not there to be found <hi>in Terminis,</hi>) but for a sufficient indication of Gods Will to have that Tenth part continued for the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of his Gospel Ministry; and though there is no express precept, yet as <hi>T. E.</hi> makes no scruple to say Christ hath repealed Tithes, because he fancys <hi>there is enough said in the New Testament, to warrant a conclusion that Tithes are to be repealed though the word be not mentioned:</hi> So I may more justly say Christ hath instituted Tithes, since I can prove <hi>there is enough said in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to warrant a conclusion, that Tithes are to be continued:</hi> And if I make it plain, that it is Christs Will, that Tithes shall remain for the part by which his Ministers are to be maintained; his Will declared is Law enough to oblige his devout Servants, and a firm consequence rationally drawn from good Premisses, is a sufficient Rule for our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; especially as to the proportion, (the only thing in Question between us) when the Maintenance it self is granted established by Divine Authority. Now the positive Laws
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:200297:98"/> for Maintenance do fairly intimate that Tithes were by Christ intended to be the proportion, as I shall make good by necessary consequence from those Laws; and then I have proved the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> as fully as I desire or need to do. My lesser promises <hi>T. E.</hi> lightly pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses over; yet even those put together will weigh with impartial Judges. 1. our Saviours declaring that the <hi>Pharisees ought to pay Tithes;</hi> which as they are a wise and just proportion of Maintenance, are an Act of Righteousness, and since his Disciples. Righteousness ought to exceed that of the <hi>Pharisees;</hi> this in <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens</hi> Opinion, (and in the Opinion of many other Ancients) it concludes, that Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth no less than a Tenth of his Disciples for the Maintenance of his Ministers. <hi>Mat.</hi> xxiii. 23. compar'd with <hi>Chap.</hi> v. 20. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Double Honour</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith a Gospel-Minister is worthy of 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> v. 17. is certainly ment of Maintenance; Honour being the Scripture phrase for these Gifts given to Superiors, in token of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Duty we ow to them; <hi>Mat.</hi> xv. 5.6. <hi>Rev.</hi> xxi. 16. <hi>Acts</hi> xxviii. 10. and if we consider that the Double Honour was the Elder Brothers Portion, ever since the Elder Brothers were Priests, and enjoyed not only their own shares of the Inheritance; but Tithes also out of the shares of the rest, by vertue of the Priesthood annext to <hi>Primoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture</hi>
                  <note n="(e)" place="margin">See <hi>Selden</hi> Hist. of Tithes Chap. 1. p. 5. and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view p. 451 452.</note>: we may well suppose the <hi>Double Honour</hi> to have been Tithes, and that St. <hi>Paul</hi> thought, as the <hi>Presbyters</hi> succeeded the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:200297:98"/> Elder Brothers in the Office; so they should in the Reward too, and means they are worthy of Tithes. Thirdly, and since God never imposes a Duty upon any sort of Men, but he Qualifies them to discharge it; we cannot think He intended the Clergy a Less proportion than Tenths, because he enjoyns them to be <hi>given to Hospitality,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 2. for which neither a small nor Arbritrary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion will suffice. Fourthly, and <hi>St. Paul</hi> making Tithes so essential to a Priesthood, yea to a Priesthood not Ceremonial; but to that Order of which Christ was, and his Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his very Argument upon this supposition, that Christs Priesthood received Tithes of <hi>Aarons</hi> Priesthood, and by that was proved greater; all this (especially being there is no express repeal of Tithes) will convince unprejudiced Men, that Christ would have the proportion to stand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 128. But we have two plainer proofs of this; the First, that place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. 13.14. <hi>Do ye not know that they which Minister a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Holy things, [i. e.</hi> the <hi>Levites] Live of the things of the Temple, [i. e.</hi> Tithes] <hi>and they which wait at the Altar, [i. e.</hi> the Priests] <hi>are partakers with the Altar [i. e.</hi> in Oblations and Sacrifices] <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>Even so hath the Lord Ordained that they which Preach the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel [i. e.</hi> the Christian Priests] <hi>should live of the Gospel [i. e.</hi> of what is due and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to God in acknowledgment for the Gospel.] From whence I observed, Firsts,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:200297:99"/> that the Maintenance of Gospel-Ministers, was to be like to that of the Jewish-Priests and <hi>Levites.</hi> 2. That Christ had made a special Ordinance it should be so. 3. That <hi>living of the Gospel,</hi> did signify, living of the things due and dedicated under the <hi>Gospel (which Mr.</hi> Mead <hi>learnedly proves, Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 226. <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> 4. That Christ who here as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed the things of the Gospel to his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters by his word, did by his Providence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the hearts of Christians to Dedicate a like Maintenance, as to the proportion, <hi>viz.</hi> Tithes; which proportion being Original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly due to God, and Ordained for, as well as assigned to the Ministers of the Gospel by Christ, yea and Dedicated also by faithful Christians moved by his Grace and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; I conclude they enjoy them now <hi>Jure Divino.</hi> This <hi>T. E.</hi> lightly passes over, and slightly calls it piecing up something that might look like a proof; when tis evident he is hard put to it, to patch up somewhat that might look like an Answer among his judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Quakers. For, <hi>First,</hi> He attempts to strain the Word <hi>[Even So]</hi> to signify ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly after the same manner: Whereas it only notes Similitude, but not Identity; Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Substance and in the main Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, not in all the lesser punctilio's. <hi>As</hi> their Maintenance was Ordained by God the Father, <hi>even so</hi> ours by God the Son; <hi>as</hi> theirs fixed in proportion, <hi>even so</hi> is ours; <hi>as</hi> theirs was a Tenth part certain besides other Oblations, <hi>even so</hi> is ours; <hi>as</hi> theirs
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:200297:99"/> were the things of the Temple and Altar, <hi>even so</hi> is ours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But theirs had many superadded Ceremonies peculiarly suited to the Levitical Dispensation, which ours hath not; and so tis not the same in all points, but alike in the main: In the Authority, ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the Office Receiving, in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who were to pay it, in the Proportion, the certainty, and the end why it was Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained: not in all the minuter Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But according to <hi>T. E.</hi> the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Maintenance is wholly unlike that under the Law, which false supposition destroys the Apostles Arguing: For why should he bring in the Right of the Levitical Priesthood to Tithes, to prove his own Right, if his Right and theirs were not alike? Or what Consequence would there be in saying, as they live of a Maintenance due by a Law; so We must live of one precarious and Arbritary: as they upon a certain part, so we upon an uncertain, as they of a Tenth part, so we of a Fifteenth, a Twentieth, or whatsoever the People please? Doth this prove our Maintenance or our Right to it to be [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] even such as theirs Doth this declare Christs care to be as great as God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's was? Yet this is the Quakers way of making the Apostles Discourse like himself, (weakly and incoherently) meerly to serve his false Positions. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He gathers from my Words, that the Maintenance was to be what Believers were willing to give freely, and supposes that it was in the Donors
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:200297:100"/> choice what part to give. But this is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest abuse of the word <hi>[Freely],</hi> which he interprets as if it meant <hi>Arbitrarily,</hi> whereas it signifies no more than <hi>Willingly;</hi> and in that Sense a man may pay a certain Due free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Thus <hi>David</hi> freely Consecrated that which was Gods own, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxix. 14. and though Alms be a due, <hi>Pro.</hi> iii, 27. yet God loves it should be given freely. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. 7. and under <hi>Moses</hi> his Polity men were commanded to dedicate their Tithes with Gladness. <hi>Eccl.</hi> xxxv. 9. So in the present case, the Testimonies of the primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers shew, that Christians then did believe the Tenth was <hi>due</hi> to God for his Ministers; and the Church Histories declare they gave it <hi>freely:</hi> They were convinced by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs practice, and Gods approbation, that the Tenth was Sacred, they found no repeal of that part; they observed how Christ had Ordained a like Maintenance for his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, as God had for the Levitical Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and this convinced them, the Tenth was still due; and considering it was now to be the Maintenance of a better Priesthood, and a grateful acknowledgment of better Rules and promises, they gave this propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion freely and chearfully, willingly and gladly; yea (I may affirm) wherever the proportion is exprest, it is always a Tenth and no other; therefore that was not Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, for if it had (been so esteemed in those Days,) some would have fixed upon some other proportion. But since wherever there
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:200297:100"/> is mention of a fixed part it is always a Tenth, doubtless they understood the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (the reward for the Gospel Message) was to be this, and by their Dedication they made it so; and since Jesus guided their hearts in that Act, we may infer it was agreeable to his Will, and the fulfilling of this Ordinance of his. To this <hi>T.E.</hi> Answers barely, <hi>[I deny it]</hi> as if his bold denyal must be as cogent with me as his false affirmings are with his credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Quakers: St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s <hi>ipse dixit</hi> will not pass with him. <hi>page</hi> 437. and yet he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cys his own <hi>ipse nego</hi> will pass with me at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very turn; and therefore he repeats it often <hi>I deny that</hi> (saith he) <hi>page</hi> 496. and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: But having found him confident e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to affirm the greatest untruths, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the plainest truths, I shall not much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard his affirming or denying. As to the matter in Question between him and me; tis plain enough the Primitive Donors of Tithes were moved by Jesus; since it appears they did believe them to be due by Gods Law, and as well just and equal in themselves, as pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Religious in their end; since they gave them by Gods direction to his Servants, and for his Honour; surely such motions can come from no other than God. And unless <hi>T. E.</hi> hath any late Revelation of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and moving cause; common Equity, and these reasons oblige him to believe that Christ moved their hearts to give Tenths; especially since this proportion complyed so well with his Ordaining, that Gospel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:200297:101"/> should be maintained <hi>even so</hi> as those under the Law were. Having therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved his Cavils, we will collect the Sense of this Text into a Syllogism thus.</p>
               <p>That which is due to Gospel Ministers by Christs Ordinance, is due to them <hi>Jure Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Tithes are due to Gospel-Ministers by Christs Ordinance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Tithes are due to them <hi>Jure Divino.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is undeniable.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is thus proved,</p>
               <p>If Christ hath Ordained that Gospel-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters shall have a Maintenance like unto the Maintenance of those that Ministred under the Law; then he hath Ordained they shall have Tithes.</p>
               <p>But Christ hath Ordained that Gospel Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters shall have a Maintenance like unto the Maintenance of those that Ministred under the Law,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> He hath Ordained they shall have Tithes.</p>
               <p>The consequence of the <hi>Major</hi> is proved, because Tithes agree in the proportion, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, and all circumstances (not peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relating to the Levitical Worship,) unto the Maintenance under the Law:</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved by 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. 13.14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 130. My next plain proof is out of <hi>Galat.</hi> vi. 6. which he runs hastily over, <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam Canis ad Nilum;</hi> and though he can spare two pages together to rail upon one
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:200297:101"/> Word, he can but afford one single page to answer two whole pages of mine; yea he spends more Paper in bragging he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed me, than in the confutation it self, <hi>page</hi> 144. 145. 146. like a Dunghil Cock, that loves not fighting when the Adversary is near, yet Crows briskly enough at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. But to leave his disingenuity, so visible in every part of his Book, my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was, that he t Apostle here enjoyns Christians to communicate some part of all their Temporal Goods to the Ministers of the Gospel, and to make them sharers and partakers with them therein. And therefore if Christians have Corn, Hay, Wool, and increase of Flocks, and Herds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the Letter of this Law they are forbidden to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them alone, and commanded to distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute part of all these to Gods Ministers, and that so, that he be not troubled to require it, for it is to be set out for him, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to him. <hi>T. E.</hi> hath no Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this, but only that which I confessed and think to be no objection, <hi>viz. That the Tenth part is not named.</hi> But I had sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved in my 66 page, that it could not be understood of any other than the Tenth part; which proofs our Adversary dismisses with saying, <hi>they are overworn stories of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;</hi> but they stand still unanswered to condemn his Quaking Novelties; and he that impartially reads them, will find there is enough said in <hi>Galat.</hi> vi. 6. to warrant a conclusion that the Tenth is the part, though
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:200297:102"/> it be not expresly mentioned. We Priests who receive Tithes did not fix this part first, but <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> by Gods direction, and so it stood by his express approbation in the time of the Law; Jews and Gentiles agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Tenth was sacred to God, even to that time when the Gospel was preached. And Jesus did no where repeal that part, nor did any man then doubt of the Tenths being Gods Part: So that this proportion being so early fixed, so long used, and so generally known and agreed to; to bid the Christians give part of all their goods to Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, was enough to make them know they must give the tenth part. For since there is one part of all our Goods assigned to Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and a Tenth part hath been long ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for that part by God, and never dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approved; this indefinite command sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses and refers to the part already determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; it intends, implies and establisheth that part, and so this Text establisheth Tithes. The Apostle supposes the part to be well known and generally agreed to; and the Christians of Old did understand the Tenth was the part intended, and so actually conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated that part to God and his Ministers; and thereby have interpreted this indefinite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to be meant of Tithes: And yet if they had not don so, before a Christian can obey this precept now, before he can give part of all his Goods; the Quantity must be fixed. I ask therefore who shall fix it? not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver sure, for he may require too much;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:200297:102"/> nor yet the giver who may allot too little: 'tis best then for God to determine it. Now if a man enquire, what part will best please God? Surely that part which he directed, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and never repealed, and that part which Jews, Gentiles and Primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans all agreed in. Is there so great assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods liking any other proportion? or so good Presidents in any other part we can fix upon? if not, then Christs general precept is to be obeyed in giving this part, especially since he told us before, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. 14. That as the Priests of the old Law were maintained; <hi>Even so</hi> should those of the Gospel be. Their chief Maintenance was a certain fixed Tenth part of all, and Ours (saith this Text) must be a part of all: what part therefore can be understood to be meant by Christ but the Tenth part? which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is now due <hi>Jure Divino.</hi> And the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be stated thus.</p>
               <p>If that part of all our Goods which the Apostle Commands us to give Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, be necessarily understood of a Tenth part; then a Tenth part is due to them <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Divino.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that part of all our Good's which the Apostle commands us to give Gods Ministers, is necessarily to be understood of a tenth part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> a Tenth part is due to Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters <hi>Jure Divino.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The consequence of the <hi>Major</hi> is undeniable.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved, by this; that at that time when this precept <hi>Galat.</hi> vi. 6. was
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:200297:103"/> written; the Tenth part was well known and agreed to by all, to be the part; it was fixed and approved by God, and never dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked, nor any other approved by God or chosen by Good men. So that the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as God had fixed it, was then Obligato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the indefinite precept must be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by it, so that when we come to fix the part, it ought to be no other than a Tenth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag,</hi> 131. But <hi>T. E.</hi> thinks he hath me at a great advantage, when upon my concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Tithes are not named in the New Testament for the Gospel-Maintenance, he asks insultingly, <hi>will he undertake to prove that out of the New Testament, which he confesses is not mentioned in the New Testament?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, the Quaker himself did undertake as much about the repeal, <hi>pag.</hi> 124. and had his consequences been fair and good, the thing is allowable enough, and tis only his Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance makes him to ask this weak Question. Did not the Holy <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers undertake to prove out of the Scriptures, that our Saviour was of the same substance with the Father; and yet confess that the word [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] was not in Scripture? And doth not the Sixth Article of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> allow that which may be proved by Scripture as well as that which is red in it, to be received as an Article of Faith, and so do all but our bold Questionist; who tels us he hath other Objections besides this, of which he produces some. <hi>First, Tithes are Ceremonial;</hi> which I have so fully disproved
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:200297:103"/> before, that we may now justly suppose them not to be Ceremonial; and may infer from thence they are proper for Christians. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> he saith Maintenance by Tithes or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other fixed and determinate Quantity is not agreeable to the Nature of the Gospel, which is free, and a state of Liberty. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns not only <hi>Selden</hi> and <hi>Willet,</hi> but his very <hi>Bohemian</hi> Stipends; and is a pure Quaker-like Objection, against all Protestant Churches in the World, as well as the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> Nay this Objection may be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all the Laws that either God or man have fixed under the Gospel, being the quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence of Antinomian Libertinism. At this rate we must have no fixed time for publick Worship; no fixed place nor persons to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, no fixed measures for Order and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency in it, no fixed Rules for Faith or Manners, no Sabbath, no Churches, no Priests, no Ceremonies; no Creeds nor Ten Commandements; away with these and Tithes all at once, these are all Legal; and <hi>T. E</hi>'s. Believers Priviledge is to be Free, they are Sons and claim the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to be Lawless; this indeed is to use Gospel Liberty for a Cloak or Cover to Wickedness <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 16. And if the Gospel did really allow any persons such liberty, it would soon destroy Religion and Government too, and bring in all confusion. St. <hi>Augustine</hi> taxes <hi>Zeno</hi> for defining Liberty to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <hi>Cicero</hi> for saying, <hi>it is a power to live as we
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:200297:104"/> will: God forbid (saith the Holy Father,) for what if a Man Will to live wickedly;</hi> ad <hi>Prob.</hi> Ep. 121. Doubtless we are no less Free when our will is directed to choose what it ought by a wise and good Law; for as <hi>Aristotle</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, it is no Abridgment of our Liberty to live according to the Law, <hi>lib.</hi> 1 <hi>Polit. cap.</hi> 9. And <hi>Cicero</hi> upon better consideration saith, Therefore we are all Servants of the Law, that we may be free; <hi>Orat. pro Cluent.</hi> And of all other Laws, can we think the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wise Laws of God and Jesus Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge our Liberty? Whatever is fixed by Divine Authority is fixed so, as he that were free ought to chose if it had not been fixed, and the fixing the Tenth part seems just and equal to all but those who look with Covetous and Factious Eyes. And for the Quakers, 'tis evident they would have the Freedom of wild Beasts, they would be quit of Laws and Magistrates, as well as Tithes; and run loose in a wild Wilderness, under no restraint from God or man, but that of their own roving fancy, falsly called, <hi>The Light within. Thirdly,</hi> He saith, under the Gospel, Tithes are not an equal way of Maintenance, neither in respect of the Giver, the Receiver, or the Service. I ask whether they were equal under the Law? if not, God was the Author of injustice; if they were, let him tell us, doth the Giver receive less, or the Receiver do less? or is the Service less worth now than under the Law? if not, then all he can pretend is, that
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:200297:104"/> a Tenth is too little: but since the Receiver thinks that enough; <hi>Volenti non fit injuria,</hi> any man may (as St <hi>Paul</hi> did) recede from his strict dues; and if any of the Laity be not satisfied the Tenth is enough, 'tis Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full still to mak voluntary Oblations besides; and this may suffice for his own weak and trifling Objections.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 133. There remains therefore only One Objection of my own raising, <hi>viz.</hi> The not naming Tithes as the very Maintenance in the New Testament; but I answered this also before, by giving Four Reasons of that silence, to which we will hear what he can reply. My <hi>First</hi> Reason is, that it was to avoid giving Offence to the Jews, whose Priests were then in possession of them. And no man can doubt but that the Apostles were very tender of offending the Jews; nor is it likely they would claim a Maintenance which they were in no capacity to receive, and which yet was in other hands, and which would have opened the mouths of the Priests against them; as being moved by worldly interest, not Zeal. But <hi>T. E.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, <hi>The Apostle in the Epistle to the</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews <hi>tells them without fear of Scandal, that the Priesthood and the Law by which they took Tithes were abrogated and ended (he should say, changed) by Christ.</hi> And yet for this Reason, that Apostle durst not put his Name to it, least he should offend the Jews; and though the Apostle did modestly some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times argue this in point of Opinion, yet in
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:200297:105"/> practice they did comply and forbear to a great degree. <hi>T. E.</hi> perhaps wil say St. <hi>Paul</hi> denyed Christ was come in the Flesh, when he circumcised <hi>Timothy, Acts.</hi> xvi. 3. and when he purified himself and offered le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Oblations according to the Vow of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarites,</hi> as the Ceremonial Law required; <hi>Acts</hi> xxi. 24. compared with <hi>Numbers</hi> vi. 18. This he did meerly that he might not offend the Jews; and therefore much more might he forbear to claim Tithes, (which <hi>T. E.</hi> weakly supposes to be meerly Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial) when as he could conveniently have received them. Again <hi>T. E.</hi> grosly mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to think converted Believers were quite taken off from the Jewish Priesthood; for the Jewish Converts long favoured their Old Priesthood: And the first fifteen Bishops of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> were all Circumcised; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Believers there at last would not part with their Old Ceremonies, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned the Sect of the <hi>Ebionites;</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected all St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles for his disputes against the Ceremonial Law; and we may perceive how St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Barnabas</hi> were both glad to comply with the Believers of the Circumcision in point of Ceremonies, 2. <hi>Gal.</hi> 11.12.13. And nothing can be more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd than <hi>T. E</hi>'s. fancy; that the Apostle might write about Tithes to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> without offending the Jews, for he forgets that the Jews lived in all Countries among the Gentiles, <hi>Acts</hi> xi. 5.9.10.11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> i.i. and could any thing have been written,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:200297:105"/> or don so publickly as the paying of Tithes, which would not have been known to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and unbelieving Jews both? Sure he dreams of whole Nations of Converted Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles among whomwere no Jews at all; which shews how little he understood the state of the World then. As appears also from his next assertion, that some of the Apostles lived to see the Jewish Priesthood wholly dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest of Tithes, and the whole Jewish Polity destroyed: Reckoning I suppose from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> which was in the fourth year of <hi>Vespasian:</hi> but St. <hi>Paul</hi> the great writer of Epistles and the only Author treating about Gospel Maintenance, dyed under <hi>Nero,</hi> long before this; and 'tis generally belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved none of the writers of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, survived the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> but St <hi>John;</hi> who hath no occasion to maintain Tithes in his Revelations which were writ after the destruction, only he prophecies of the Liberal Donations afterward made to the Christian Church, <hi>Rev.</hi> xxi. 24. Besides <hi>T. E.</hi> mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to think the Jewish Polity was wholly destroyed, or Tithes ceased to be payd at the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> as I can prove if there be occasion. But this is certain, that the Christians of that Age did all they could to win the Jews; and ('tis likely by direction from the Apostles) observed the Feast of <hi>Easter;</hi> and kept the Saturday Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and forbore a while to claim or give Tithes to the Evangelical Priesthood.</p>

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 135. My Second Reason why Tithes are not enjoyned by name, was because it was needless, since they were sufficiently known to be due to God <hi>before</hi> the Gospel began to be preached; as well in the time of the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> as under <hi>Moses</hi> Law: Which <hi>T. E.</hi> knows to be my meaning, only want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Answer he cavils at the word <hi>[before]</hi> and pretending (as his custom is) to have already refuted this Assertion, he dismisses it. But since I have proved, as well before as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Law, that Tithes were sufficiently declared to be Gods due, and shewed that the grounds on which they were given, was to acknowledg God the giver of all; and the end for which they were employed, was to maintain the Service of God, which grounds and end remain in force still: I suppose the Impartial Reader will conclude that there was no need to determine the proportion a new; but leaving that upon its first founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, our Saviour needed only to declare he would have Maintenance continued, and paid out of all our Goods, to his Gospel-Ministers; and the proportion being well setled before and never repealed, is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently established by these Laws of his: Even as (I shewed at large) he did in the Case of the Seventh part of our time, the exact pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to the Tenth part of our Estate; and to this the Quaker makes no reply, and therefore it stands and remains a good Reason still; and as yet unanswered.</p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:200297:106"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 136, 137. My Third Reason why a Tenth was not enjoyned by Name was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Christians in those Daies gave more than a Tenth freely, selling all and giving it to the Apostles: But <hi>T. E.</hi> saith this is more than I can prove: very strange! I proved they gave all, and yet he saith I cannot prove they gave more than a Tenth; is not All more than a Tenth part? Who hath aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned all Reason and Modesty now? He grants, they laid the price at the Apostles feet, and yet saith, this was not given to the Apostles for their proper use: being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the meaning of this phrase [<hi>laying</hi> or <hi>putting</hi> at, or <hi>under the feet</hi>] which (as <hi>Grotius</hi> notes) signifies that they <hi>put it wholly into the Apostles power,</hi> as when <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>He hath put all things under mans feet,</hi> Psal. viii. 6. he means, <hi>God gave us Power and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over all Creatures.</hi> And though in their circumstances they needed it not at all themselves, and so their Charity enclined them to Communicate to all that had need; this no way proves it was not given to them, and put into their power, for though God likewise freely give us all, yet he expects we should give part of it back to his Ministers and the Poor, and because we do thus in a pious obedience to God's Law; will any man argue, we are not Masters of our own Estates? Do not I shew my right to a thing as well by giving it to another, as by spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it on my self? Again how strangely the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:200297:107"/> Quaker mistakes in saying, <hi>It is enough for his purpose that it was a Free Gift:</hi> For since they gave all, and gave it freely, doth not that prove my present reason, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Devotion of that Age was great, and needed not a new determination of the Tenth part, which is the lowest measure? In stead of answering which Reason, he racks my words and jumbles them together, hoping to escape from the Argument by charging me with his ordinary fault, <hi>Self-contradiction,</hi> but let any man read those Pages in my first Book cited by the Quaker, and he will see how vainly he tugs at that Oar: and I shall only reply to this weak attempt of his, That he begs and supposes, that nothing can be established unless it be named; forgetting his pretended repeal hath neither the name of Tithes, nor yet of a repeal in it, and not considering that sober and judicious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants generally hold the Christian Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath established in the New Testament, though no Precept mention it by name. If our Lord could not create a Right to Tithes without express naming them, yet he might establish them, as he did many other things by general Rules: and the fervent Devotion, and vast liberality of that, and some follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ages, made it needless to name that measure which they alwaies exceeded; the Tenth was a Bound below which none might go in the worst times, and to have named that positively▪ had been to curb the Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the best Ages, when the general po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:200297:107"/> of the Church made it highly necessary for those few that were able, to give above the proportion suted to settled times. My Reason being thus made good, I shall only observe his ridiculous Etymology of <hi>[Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae à Decimo]</hi> wherein this shame of Peda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, derives the Nominative Case Plural from the Ablative Case Singular, or else from a Verb that is a Derivative as well as <hi>[Decimae]</hi> for both of them <hi>[Decimae &amp; Decimo]</hi> are derived from <hi>[Decem]</hi> which if <hi>T. E.</hi> knows not, he never was fit to teach Grammer, and this foolish Etymology of his, is no better than to derive one Brother from another, when both are derived from one common Parent: but 'tis below me to lash such folly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 138, 139. I had Argued that our Lord fore-saw the great effects his Gospel and his Grace were like to have upon the hearts of those Ages, and knowing they would give more than a Tenth, he might justly forbear to determine the proportion too expresly; to this we have nothing but poor evasions, <hi>vez.</hi> That because Christ left the gratifying his Ministers to the voluntary Devotion of those times which he knew would give more than a Tenth, therefore it should be left so still, as if there were the same reason for that Age and this, for those those that were ready to sell all, as many (yet upon record) did, and for those who through Quakerism or Covetousness, or both, will
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:200297:108"/> part with nothing; which is, as if <hi>T. E.</hi> should argue, there need no Spurs to a dull Horse, because a free Horse will go without. And besides, he mistakes to think Christ left it wholly arbitrary, for he Ordained that Gospel Ministers should be maintained <hi>[even so]</hi> as the Jewish Priests were for the main; he ordained they should have part of all their goods. The Tenth part was then the known proportion, below which the Patriarchs, nor the Jews, no, nor yet the Gentiles, did not go; and though Christ left them at Liberty to give more than that, yet not at that Quaker-like licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Liberty to give nothing, or to give less, when and what they please; so a great Father of the next Age (to whose words I allude in my 71 Page) understood that freedom of Sons under the Gospel, <hi>They truly</hi> (that is the Jews) <hi>had the Tenth of their Possessions consecrated: But they who have received Liberty, do set apart all they have to the Lord's Service, cheerfully and freely giving not that which is less, because they have a greater▪</hi> Iren. <hi>adv. haeres. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 34. There was enough said to move some Ages to give more, enough to perswade others that it was Christ's Will they should not give less, and when men grew remiss, then (and not before) it was necessary to draw the fair Inferences of these Texts into express Laws, and by those Laws to declare that Christ had sufficiently intimated his Will to be that a Tenth part at least should be given to his Ministers,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:200297:108"/> and accordingly the Canons and Laws made for paying Tithes in after Ages, do all suppose them due by God's Law before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 140, 141. My Fourth Reason for the not requiring Tithes by Name then, was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the unsettled state of the Church which permitted not Believers to pay them regularly though they were willing: This <hi>T. E.</hi> saies should have been assigned for a reason why Tithes should not have been paid at all under the Gospel: Why so? doth the Quaker think the Church was alwaies to be unsettled? Because their unstable Sect nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is nor ever can be settled, but must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies hover in uncertainties, and change as the Wind turns; doth it follow, the Church was never to be settled? As soon as King's and Princes became Converts, the Church was fixed, and Maintenance fixed also agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thereunto, but in the mean time things were done as well as they could in that State; But he asks how I know Believers were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have paid Tithes, and Ministers to receive them there, had opportunity served? I answer, because they often gave more, in Money and in such things as Ministers could receive: Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> will tell him, that even in <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> his time [<hi>An.</hi> 370.] <hi>The Clergy were so enrich'd that their wealthy happiness thence was much wondered at, and not a little from thence envyed.</hi> Hist. Tithes, p. 40. And can we doubt whether these men were willing to pay Tithes? See also <hi>Selden</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, <hi>p.</hi> 462. And since the Church could
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:200297:109"/> not regularly receive them then; Since that most bountiful Devotion of good Christians continued, and enough was said to shew it was God's Will the old proportion should stand, as soon as it could be paid with conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience; what need was there to name that proportion then? Though many things be named in the New Testament that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to future times, yet many that were well known and well settled before, are not named in any new Precepts, but left under General Commands, and yet do certainly oblige us. I grant that in the times of Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, they were not regularly paid, no more than they were to the <hi>Levites</hi> in the Wilderness, and yet as that was no prejudice to their Right, so neither was this to ours, and if their Right was settled by an express Law, ours was Ordained with an <hi>[Even so.]</hi> The proportion was first fixed by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from God, and many evidences given of his approbation, and not one of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of it, and therefore as to the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Right was as well settled as the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> and can be as little prejudiced by a non-payment occasioned by necessity: I am sure the Tenth part was so settled under the Gospel, that the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> did know that was the part intended by Christ and his Apostles. Here <hi>T. E.</hi> wisely asks, <hi>How I know this, seeing the Scripture is silent of it?</hi> Excellently urged! But is this knowing man so ignorant to think we can know nothing of the Primitive Christians, but what we know
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:200297:109"/> by Scripture? He pretends to learn something of them from Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> and something from <hi>Perkins</hi> his <hi>Problema,</hi> at second hand: and cannot I know their sense from their own Genuine writings? I doubt not in the next Chapter to shew I did well know their mind, and that they did believe them due <hi>Jure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino,</hi> and yet since they were hindered by unavoidable necessity, they were excused from doing even what they knew to be their Masters will, even as a Prisoner is from fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting the Publick Worship, and if <hi>T. E.</hi> argues right (when he falsly supposing their non-payment, inferrs them not appointed by Christ) then when I shall prove their payment, it will follow they were appointed by Christ, and so due <hi>Jure Divino.</hi> And <hi>[This]</hi> that is, <hi>These Texts, and all these Reasons considered together;</hi> are sufficient to establish this Right of Tithes under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, without an express renewed Precept for that proportion by name.</p>

E.</hi> after his wonted manner singles out that, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing I have proved nothing, impudently brags I beg the Question, and cants upon the naked Conclusion for two or three Pages to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, calling a fresh for my Texts (which he hastily skipped over when I produced them) as if he had never heard of them; What baser equivocation can Jesuits use?
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:200297:110"/> or who would engage with so disingenuous an Adversary? But the discerning Reader may easily perceive these are — <hi>ad populum phale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> Sallets fit for Quakers Lips, and as he saith himself, <hi>Fair words to please Fools:</hi> 'Tis the way of their own Speakers falsly to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose themselves Saints, Children of God, Spiritual men, and men in the Light; and all others, Reprobates, Enemies to God, Carnal men, and such as sit in Darkness, without the least proof, and yet upon these suppositions they rail at all others, and damn them with as much confidence, as they cry up their own Party, and appropriate Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to themselves; and <hi>T. E.</hi> thinks wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I am such a one as himself, but I appeal to the impartial Reader, whether I have not sufficiently proved my premises, and whether it be not absurd and dishonest both for him to over-look all that, and deny my Conclusion upon the false supposition that I precariously assert it.</p>

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:200297:110"/> Pages, as I noted in the Preface: leaving him therefore to glory in his shame, I shall only make some Observations on his two closing Authors <hi>Fulk</hi> and <hi>Willet. First,</hi> For Dr. <hi>Fulk</hi> I have shewed he can be no Witness for <hi>T. E.</hi> in regard he holds Tithes may be established under the Gospel, which if they were Ceremonial, could not be; and in the most of this Period now cited against me, the Doctor and I agree, <hi>viz. That as it was a Ceremonial Duty, it is Abrogated. That there is now no Sacrificing Priesthood to whom Tithes are due, and though there be a Priesthood now maintained by Tithes, yet the old payment of Tithes doth not prove there is any such Priesthood as there was then</hi> (For the Doctor supposes as I do, that different Priesthoods may have the same maintenance) <hi>That Christ and his Apostles did not claim them for their own Maintenance.</hi> I have confessed and shewed why they did not. All that we differ in is, that in his heat against the pretended sacrificing Priesthood of <hi>Rome,</hi> which the <hi>Rhemists</hi> would justifie from one of <hi>T. E</hi>'s principles (<hi>viz.</hi> That the same Maintenance proves the same Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood) the Doctor unwarily asserts that Tithes may be turned into a Stipend suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, or may stand as the Magistrate pleases: but since the Magistrate hath ordered these to stand, the Doctor allows not covetous private men to detain them, and if in dispute he do deny that <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> which I assert, yet I have so many more and greater men of my side, that if it had been his free opinion
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:200297:111"/> (and not a Position which he was forced to take up to defend his Cause) his Authority is sufficiently weighed down. <hi>Secondly,</hi> For Doctor <hi>Willet,</hi> he is sadly mistaken himself in that Canon of the Council of <hi>Orleance,</hi> which the Quaker repeats out of him: For he mistakes both the words and the sense of it. That Canon being not concerning Tithes paid by the people, but concerning volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary gifts from the Higher to the Lower Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. And the words are, <hi>Concerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Bounty which any Clergy Man shall think fit to communicate for their support, as it is in the power of the giver</hi> [tribuere quibus volue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit] <hi>to give</hi> (not <hi>what,</hi> as the Doctor reads, but) <hi>to whom he pleases: so if there be any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience or stubbornness found in the Receiver, upon a declaration of the fault</hi> [in arbitrio sit Praesidentis] <hi>it shall be in the Bishops power, whether or how far he shall revoke his gift.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. 3. <hi>Aurel.</hi> Can. 17. <hi>Bin.</hi> T. 2. p. 2. pag. 29. And surely the Doctor hastily mis-read <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentis</hi> for <hi>Praesidentis,</hi> for otherwise it cannot be imagined how he should be so deceived, as to fancy they said it was in the Givers power to revoke Tithes, since that very Counsel, <hi>Can.</hi> 22. <hi>Excommunicates him of whatsoever Order he be, who presumes to revoke that which he hath given to the Church.</hi> Indeed it was in the Bishops power to determine temporary and arbitrary Donations, for by the fifth Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the same Council, all the Acquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Revenues of the Church are put into his power. And therefore this Council sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:200297:111"/> Gifts to be not revocable, &amp; referring all kind even of arbitrary Donations among the Clergy to one another, to the Bishops decision, did believe the Word of God did lay a necessity on such Gifts, and (as the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of that Age proves) on Tithes among the rest. Again, the Doctor is much over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen to instance in the <hi>Ethiopick</hi> Church, as one in which no Tithes were paid, for the <hi>Ethiopick</hi> Liturgy (which I have by me) hath a Prayer (which <hi>T. E.</hi> may read in <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> pag. 66.) to this effect, <hi>For those who have offered their gifts to the Holy Church, the Sacrifice of their First-Fruits and Tithes, the sign and monument of their gratitude,</hi> &amp;c. Which things I do not remark with any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure to that learned man, only <hi>Opere in longo fas est obrepere somnum,</hi> He was mistaken in these things, and in his opinion about Tithes too, especially since he seems to bring in the Alterableness of them as the Opinion of this Church, whereas it is certain the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of our <hi>English</hi> Protestant Divines, have maintained them due by God's Law, as I have shewed before, so that the Quaker can neither defend himself by Reason nor Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in this matter.</p>

Here <hi>T.

E.</hi> (suspecting he should not be able to make any satisfactory reply) cunningly anticipates my Arguments by pretending, that all this is to prove the Humane Right, which (he falsly saies) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the Divine Right, and desires his Reader to believe, that is yet unproved, and according this must needs fall with it: All which is false and precarious, for <hi>First,</hi> when I bring in the Opinion of Primitive Fathers and Councils asserting the Divine Right, I am not proving the Human Right only, but bringing in the best of Witnesses, that the Divine Right is the sense of Holy Scripture. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Neither doth the Human Right so depend on the Divine Right, as that one must Fall with the other; for if so, then his two Doctors were out in denying the Antecedent <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> and yet holding the Human Right of Tithes now established, and 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sure we have a good Human Right to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:200297:113"/> things for which we cannot pretend a <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> himself saith, <hi>Whatever is lawfully established by a Civil Title is clearly</hi> debitum justiciae. <hi>Praef. pag.</hi> 15. So that supposing I had not made out the <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> yet if I make out the Human Right I do sufficiently prove them due in Equity, if nothing in God's Law expresly prohibit that Human Right. And again if I should not make out the Human Right, yet if I have made out the Divine Right, that stands good still in Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s Opinion, <hi>Let Human Laws, Practice and Opinion</hi> (saith he) <hi>be as their Authors, yet whatsoever Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be found in the Law of God for the Right of Tithes, remains still as untoucht, and equally of his former power, as the Heat and Light of Heaven ever did, notwithstanding the use of Fire upon Earth.</hi> Praef. p. 15. So that <hi>T. E.</hi> mistakes to think his disproving one of these disproves the other, and 'tis but a poor come off, for him who bragged in his Title Page, <hi>He had removed all four Posts,</hi> now to be forced to beg of us to believe he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved one, and thence to infer, the others fall with it.</p>
               <p n="1">§. 1. PAg. 154. <hi>T. E.</hi> begins with Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie in saying, <hi>I begin with the Apostles times,</hi> whereas I had treated of those times before, and expresly say, <hi>I will look back into the Primitive times,</hi> pag. 75. But this falshood was necessary to introduce his
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:200297:114"/> four next Pages, which are all grounded upon this unjust pretence, that I am speaking here of what was upon record in Holy Scripture; whereas my words and sense are very plainly concerning the Primitive Christians of the Age next to the Apostles, for my words are, <hi>The Apostles having given a general Rule,</hi> (viz. <hi>Gal.</hi> vi. 6. in their own time spoken of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) <hi>for the Faithful to communicate to their Teachers in all good things, the Primitive Christians</hi> (that is, those of the Age follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) <hi>did alwaies make liberal oblations to their Pastors, not only of Houses and Lands, as we read in Holy Scripture, but also of Money and other things, which being collected every Lords Day, was delivered to the Bishop,</hi> saith <hi>Justin Martyr.</hi> The plain sense of which words is, that the Christians of the Age following the Apostles, did offer Houses and Lands (as those mentioned in Scripture did) and many other things besides, which were put into the Bishop's hands, as <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> assures us. To which his first Cavil is, that he might put in the word <hi>[only]</hi> the Apostles having left <hi>only</hi> a general <hi>Rule,</hi> &amp;c. And what then? suppose they did leave only a general <hi>Rule,</hi> the Primitive Christians must come to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular things &amp; quantity too before they could actually give; and if putting in, would have done him any service, we have seen he makes no scruple of that at all. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He asks me, where I read in Scripture that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians gave Houses and Lands? I reply, that I am speaking of the times after the Apostles
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:200297:114"/> whose History is not to be expected in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: yet even there we read of some who gave Houses and Lands to the Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Prices of them, it being usual in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Speech to say, <hi>we give</hi> that, whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire <hi>value</hi> we give. <hi>T. E.</hi> had best play such Tricks with the Apostles words (as he does with mine) and charge them with non-sense for saying, <hi>The Oyntment might have been sold for much, and given to the Poor,</hi> Matth. xxvi. 9. yea Christ bids the young man, <hi>Sell that he hath and give to the poor,</hi> that is, Give it when it is sold, Give it turned into Money, which is more convenient for the poor, than Houses and Lands are: So these Christians (as <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> think) gave Houses and Lands first; but because settlements of Houses and Lands were not thought durable provisions in <hi>Judaea,</hi> which they believed would shortly be destroyed; therefore they turned them into Money, and gave them so: yet even in Scripture we read elsewhere (out of <hi>Judaea</hi>) of Churches in some Christians Houses, <hi>Rom.</hi> xvi. 4. <hi>Colos.</hi> iv. 15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xvi. 19. <hi>Phil. v.</hi> 2. which <hi>Oecumenius</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds of consecrating their Houses for the assembling of the Saints: and Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> proves that these Houses were given to God <hi>in Specie,</hi> see his Proofs for Churches. <hi>Cent.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 20, 21. yea there is extant a genuine Epistle of <hi>Pius</hi> 1.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:200297:115"/> Not to inlarge now into all other Authors, <hi>Nazianzen</hi> will acquaint us that there were many who had consented to let their whole Houses be appropriated to the Church; and <hi>Eusebius</hi> mentions the Restitution of Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and other Possessions which had been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to and enjoyed by the Church long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Constantine, Euseb. l.</hi> 10. <hi>c.</hi> 5. and St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> is specially remarked to have given his Houses and Land to the Church; about whose time Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> saith, <hi>that the most bountiful Devotion of good Christians continued in frequent offerings both of Land and Goods to a large value,</hi> See his Review <hi>pag.</hi> 462 and though he suppose this selling all and living in common was not long in use; yet even when <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> writ his second Apology, it did remain, <hi>Ann.</hi> 160. For he saith there, <hi>We that loved Money and the profits of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states above all things, now bringing all that we have into one common Stock; we communicate with the poorest, &amp;c.</hi> And the Custom of that age assures us, all this was deposited with the Bishop, who did dispose of it as he saw fit. And now I hope <hi>T. E.</hi> is satisfyed, that Houses, Lands, Money and other things were given by the Primitive Christians to their Pastors.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:200297:115"/>§. 2. PAg. 158. My Adversary hath no mind to enter upon the Argument of the Primitive Practice, and good Reason, for he knows nothing of it; but what he gleans from Modern relators; and because Mr <hi>Selden</hi> mentions not <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> poor <hi>T. E.</hi> lets him pass unexamined, though he testify the large Donations to the Clergy of his Age, who in Oblations had sufficiently for themselves and for all sorts of Charity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. But since he doth not take notice of him, we shall next enquire whether there was not something in that large Maintenance answerable to Tithes, yea whether Tithes themselves were not payd, (before any Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws about them) purely in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Law of God. I brought <hi>Irenaeus</hi> to prove this, who plainly affirms, <hi>We, (i. e.</hi> we Christians) <hi>ought to Offer to God the first Fruits of his Creatures.</hi> And though he cite a piece of <hi>Moses</hi> to prove it; yet it is a <hi>Moral Precept of not appearing before the Lord empty;</hi> which obliged Christians in <hi>Irenaeu</hi>'s Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to Offer some Oblation to God whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they came to his Solemn Worship, see 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xvi. 2, and those kind of Oblations he affirms are not abrogated, but remain Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory to us; which shews he thought First-Fruits, (and what he meant by them we shall see presently) ought to be paid by Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Now if <hi>First-fruits</hi> be Obligatory, why not <hi>Tithes?</hi> these were first enjoyned by a
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:200297:116"/> written Law under <hi>Moses,</hi> as wel as Tithes, these were the Maintenance of the Levitical Priesthood as well as Tithes; these had Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies annexed as Tithes had; and there is better proof of Tithes before the Law, than of First-fruits. So that if <hi>T. E.</hi> would understand by First-fruits somewhat differing from Tithes; yet still he grants a Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, once Ceremonial, continued to the Gospel-Ministers; and must shew some Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why not Tithes as well as First-fruits. But the very Truth is, as well in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> as in other Ancient writers these words <hi>[First-fruits]</hi> and <hi>[Tithes]</hi> are used promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously; and First-fruits are often put for Tithes, especially in those Authors which writ Originally in Greek, as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> did in those works whose Translations only we read; and therein the word <hi>[Primitiae]</hi> which we may first observe in <hi>Philo,</hi> whose phrase most of the Greek Fathers imitate, and he cals Tithing of Cattel, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> First-fruits.) Again he evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently uses <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, by <hi>First-fruits is in Tenths, Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 30. and if that be good Sense, then surely First-fruits may be paid in the proportion of a Tenth, and were so it seems among the Gentiles. So that neither Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> nor his <hi>Plagiary</hi> need Wonder, why <hi>Origen,</hi> when he mentions <hi>Tithes</hi> in his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, should in his <hi>Conclusion leave out Tithes and speak only of First-fruits, Selden p.</hi> 41. For the reason is plain, <hi>viz.</hi> Because he took them both to signify the same thing under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. And if I may add my Conjecture why he and other Fathers and Councils did so use First-fruits for Tithes, I suppose it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Christians paid rather more than a Tenth part; and so though they paid it as Tithes, yet their Devotion and Bounty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining them usually to exceed that Quantity; it could not be so very strictly named <hi>[Tithes]</hi> as <hi>[First-fruits]</hi> because First-fruits were a proportion greater or less according to the Piety of the Giver; and therefore <hi>Aelian</hi> spake very exactly when he called that which
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:200297:117"/> was not a strict Tenth part. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>Hist. an. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 53. And especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally since the word [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] signifies the very chief and best in Quality also, as well as that which was first Offered, before any use was made of the other parts, see 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xv. 21. in LXX. and <hi>James</hi> i. 18. And good Christians paid Tithes always of the first and the best things: And this may serve to prove that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and other Fathers and Councils meant <hi>Tithes</hi> by <hi>First-fruits;</hi> and if there was any difference, it was in that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians offered somewhat more, as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his 2 Quotation shews, which plainly affirms, that the Christians gave not less than the Jews; and supposes they g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="3 letters">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o besides, I now add, that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> did reckon Tithes a part of the Moral Law; for when he comes to reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on up the precepts thereof, which he saith <hi>Christ came not to dissolve but enlarge, he instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in these, Thou shalt not commit Adultery, thou shalt not Kill, thou shalt pay Tithes.</hi> Lib. 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 27. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> therefore witnesses, that Christians in his days (140 years after Christ's Death) Offered First-fruits, and that in the Proportion of a Tenth at least, never under; esteeming Tithes as part of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law, not abrogated by Christ, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at least a Tenth and expected more from them. And all this they did before any Humane Law enjoyned them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o it; purely because they believed God required it of them, which is plain Evidence that the <hi>Jus
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:200297:117"/> Divinum</hi> was believed in that Age.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 159. And considering the <hi>Apostolical Canons</hi> were made not long after <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his time; his Testimony gives great Credit to what they say in this matter, concerning the usage of paying the First-fruits of Honey, Milk, Liquors, Birds and Beasts, Pulse, Grapes and Corn, which are ordered to be sent to the Bishops House as First-fruits for him and his Presbyters <hi>Can.</hi> 3. and 4. and the Christian writers of that Age do so agree in this matter, as a Learned Author of this Church hath lately proved,<note n="(a)" place="margin">

And whereas <hi>T.

                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:200297:118"/> which that Council condemns; as <hi>T.

Council is so far from condemning them that they esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish them by name as genuine and Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick; for when they come to reckon up what Writings, are to be received by the Church, these Fathers say, <hi>also those</hi> 85 <hi>Canons received and established by our most Holy Fathers, that were before us; and delivered unto us under the name of the most Holy and Glorious Apostles, shall from henceforth remain firm and undoubted. Concil.</hi> 6. in <hi>Trul. Can.</hi> 2. I hope <hi>T. E.</hi> will rather confess his folly than own so manifest a dishonesty, and declare that Mr <hi>Perkins</hi> led him into this Error; from which his inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration it seems did not secure him. But though in Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> his Latine Copy it be <hi>Liber Canonum, &amp;c. pag.</hi> 7. yet he that translated the Demonstration of the Problem, saw the Error; for there tis amended and the English Copy hath it, <hi>The Book of Apostolical Constitutions, page</hi> 556. But the Quaker is led blindfold, and if his Leader leave one Stone in his way, he certainly tumbles over it, and therefore is not fit at all to write of these matters; for he runs again into this same mistake, when he tells us Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his review shews at large that these Canons are false; for Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in that review of the 4th. Chapter p, 462. 463. 464. is disputing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Constitutions, not the Canons. Indeed he (who is wont to discredit every
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:200297:118"/> thing that sutes not with his designe) calls them <hi>Counterfeit Canons;</hi> but that may respect only the name, <hi>viz.</hi> when they are attributed to the Apostles as Authors, for he thinks the Apostles did not make them, see <hi>Seld.</hi> Chap. 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 43. And I think so too, and therefore I called them not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Canons, but the <hi>Apostolical Canons,</hi> and said, <hi>they were the Decrees of divers Christian Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods in the times of Persecution;</hi> and as such, they are now proved genuine and Authentic by so much Learning and force of Reason and Authority in Dr. <hi>Beverege</hi> his late Tract cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Codex Canonum Eccles. Primit. Vindicatus,</hi> &amp;c. that no men of either Learning or Modesty will Question their Authenticalness hereafter. Here then we have a Second un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Testimony for the Payment of First-fruits (the name of this Age for Tithes) in so large a Quantity as that the Bishops House was made the Storehouse of them and this, while the Emperors were Heathen, about the year of Christ 200.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. PAg. 160. My next witness is <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> (who as we have shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) affirms, <hi>That the Law of Tithes and First-fruits ought to stand in force now; and pleads the Equity of it in the Quotation which I cited here;</hi> and all that <hi>T. E.</hi> can say against it, is that <hi>Origen</hi> mentions only First-fruits and not Tithes; I Answer that (besides what I have said before to prove his using
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:200297:119"/> these phrases promiscuously,) Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> himself confesses pag. 41. That <hi>Origen</hi> speaks of Tithes, when he saith, <hi>We are taught to observe these, by the very word of God himself, according to the Letter.</hi> And is not all that exposition about Tithing Mint, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and exceeding the Righteousness of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees intended by <hi>Origen</hi> to prove Tithes due under the Gospel? And when <hi>Origen</hi> there speaks of the Jews, how they paid Tithes to the Levites, and First-fruits to the Priests; <hi>and shall I (saith he) doing neither of these (i. e.</hi> neither paying Tithes nor First-fruits) <hi>use the Fruits of the Earth so as the Priest know not of it?</hi> &amp;c. and then he concludes that this Law which he had been Disputing for, ought to stand. And if the word be only [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] considering the use of that word, and also the scope of <hi>Origens</hi> premisses; it must be granted he disputed for Tithes as well as First-fruits. But it is clear enough that <hi>Origen</hi> used First-fruits for Tithes, by that place of his admired work against <hi>Celsus</hi> the <hi>Pagan.</hi> For speaking of what the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens gave to their Gods, (among which were Tithes, as we have fully proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,) he saith, Celsus <hi>would have First-fruits Consecrated to</hi> Demons, <hi>but we to him that said, let the Earth bring forth, to him we give our Fist-fruits, to whom we send up our Prayers.

E.</hi> would have the Name of Tithes in <hi>Origen,</hi> we have that also <hi>Hom.</hi> 16. in <hi>Genes.</hi> where he saith; <hi>The Number Ten is venerable in the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:200297:119"/> Old Testament and in the New. And because God is the Author of both, and one Christ the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Fountain of both; therefore also the People give Tithes to the Ministers and the Priests.</hi> So that we have a third full and clear witness for Opinion and Practice both, to confirm us that the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> was continued to be believed in the Church <hi>Ann.</hi> 210.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 161.] About 40 years after lived St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> whose works <hi>T. E,</hi> hath fairly consulted at second hand in Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> and takes upon him to correct my Exposition of a Sentence of his; but how, truly now I must enquire. St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> (who had given his own Patrimony to the Church) commends the first Converts who sold their Houses and Lands, and who laying up their Treasure in Heaven, offered the Prices of them to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles to be distributed to those that need; and hereupon blaming the remisness of his own Age saith, <hi>At nunc Patrimonio nec De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimas Damus; But now we do not so much as give Tithes out of our Patrimony or Inheritance.</hi> So it is to be translated, whatsoever Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> or his Eccho say to the contrary: for I appeal to any Grammarian, if <hi>Patrimonio decimas dare,</hi> can without violence or into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable harshness be translated or made to signify, <hi>the Tenth part of a Mans Patrimony;</hi> that had been <hi>Decimam partem Patrimonii,</hi> but <hi>Decimas</hi> is plainly <hi>Tithes,</hi> and <hi>Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,</hi> is, <hi>from, or out of our Patrimony;</hi> the Tenths of the Profit, not of the Land. But
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:200297:120"/> nothing is more ordinary with Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> than to pervert wilfully the Sense of those Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors that agree not with his espoused Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; of which unjust dealing this corrupt gloss is a plain instance. For <hi>T. E.</hi> he wink's and follows, and is glad of any thing to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his bad cause; but I know the unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced Reader will see, that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> thought, if Christians were not so perfect as to sell all, yet at least they ought to give Tithes; and that he counted it a fault to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it. But <hi>Perkins</hi> hath (as the Quaker thinks) helpt him to another Cavil, <hi>viz.</hi> That this Book of St. <hi>Cyprians, de Ʋnitate Ecclesiae,</hi> is suspected to have been corrupted. To which I Answer, we know both that it hath been corrupted, and by whom, and in what places, and for what end; for Dr. <hi>James</hi> the first discoverer, hath by Old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscripts found out, that the Papists to set up the Popes Supremacy, have added several passages, and in his excellent Censure of the Fathers he sets down all the places, <hi>pag.</hi> 11. But neither <hi>Perkins, Selden,</hi> nor any other question this place, and indeed it conduces nothing to the corrupters designs; yea and it agrees not only with the Doctrine of other Fathers of that Age, but with what he speaks in one of his Epistles; where Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> grants that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> says, The Clergy had a Maintenance proportionable to the <hi>Levites;</hi> and yet he would fain perswade us it was not Tithes. The Epistle is to check a Clergy man for immersing himself in Worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:200297:120"/> and therein he saith, that the <hi>Levites</hi> were provided for on purpose, so liberally, that they might not be hindred from Divine Administrations. And then he adds, <hi>which Reason and Form is now kept in the Clergy, that they who are promoted to Holy Orders in the Church, should by no means be called off from Divine Administrations, but in the Honour of the Brethren who are allotted their portion, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as it were Tithes of Fruits, should not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from the Altar and the Sacrifices: Cypr. Epist. l.</hi> 1. 9. Now since the <hi>Levites</hi> Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance was so large, for this reason, that they might not labour in worldly affairs, and the form of it was by way of Tithes; if (as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith) the same <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> was held in his time among the Christian Clergy; then these were as liberally main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained as they, and in the same form, for the main. Only <hi>Cyprian</hi> notes the difference when he saith, <hi>receiving as it were, Tithes of Fruits;</hi> because in the Christian Church then all Tithes <hi>in Specie</hi> were paid to the Bishop (as well as the times would permit) and the Bishop (whose Clergy then resided in the Cities with him for the most part) allotted every Priest his <hi>Sportula</hi> or portion of all necessaries out of the whole store; so that the inferior Clergy did not receive Tithes of Fruits <hi>in Specie</hi> of the people, but had an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable portion out of them allotted by the Bishop which was, <hi>as it were Tithe of Fruits.</hi> That is, it was the same thing in effect, and the People paid the Tithe, only the State of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:200297:121"/> the Church then, would allow of no other way to take and distribute them. Which being the true sense of this passage, (as all who know the State of the Primitive Church will grant) it follows, that the People paid Tithes then, and the Bishop received and distributed them; and this being not then enjoyned by any Humane Law, it was done in obedience to Gods Law, and so it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother evidence of the continuance of the Practice of Tithing, and the Opinion of their being due <hi>Jure Divino. An.</hi> 250.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 162. I laid not much stress upon the next Testimony out of <hi>Clements Constitutions,</hi> yet because the Quaker doth so unjustly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate it; I shall now prove that this is no such mean Evidence as he pretends. <hi>Perkins</hi> truly saith, this is none of the writings of <hi>Clemens Romanus,</hi> and <hi>Selden</hi> will allow it to be made by the Apostles, and so far I agree with them both. But we have better Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than either of them; that it is a very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Collection, and made by another <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (perhaps <hi>Clemens Alexandr.</hi>) St <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi> mentions it by the name of <hi>the Doctrine of the Apostles, and reckons it among the Books which the Fathers allowed to be read.</hi> Ep. ad <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Mon.</hi> St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> cites a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence out of it (as <hi>Clement</hi> writes, saith he, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) So doth St <hi>Chrysostom Hom.</hi> 53. in <hi>Math. Epiphanius</hi> cites it divers times <hi>L.</hi> 1. <hi>Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>haer.</hi> 45. and <hi>L.</hi> 3. <hi>T.</hi> 1 <hi>haer.</hi> 75. And he gives us this Character of it, <hi>the Constitutions of the Apostles are doubted by many, but not rejected,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:200297:121"/> for all regular Order is contained in them, and nothing corrupted either as to Faith and Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or as to Church-Government, and Rules.</hi> Epiph. <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>T.</hi> 1. <hi>haer.</hi> 70. So that in <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> his Opinion those Constitutions which are for Tithes and First-Fruits are neither contrary to sound Doctrine nor good order. 'Tis true, the 6. Council in <hi>Trullo</hi> near two hundred years after complains, that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks had mingled their Corruptions with them, and obscured the glory of what was Divine in them, and upon that score only they censure them, for <hi>Aristenus</hi> his Epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of that Canon is, <hi>Let those things which the Hereticks have conveyed by stealth into the Apostolical Constitutions by</hi> Clement, <hi>be rejected.</hi> So that what there is in them agreeable to the Doctrine of all Orthodox Fathers, and that which was never accounted or called Heresie, that may and ought to be received still, and such is the Doctrine of Tithes and First-Fruits, which this Author saith <hi>are given to the Bishops according to the Commandment of God:</hi> So that here is still another Witness of the <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> yet if our Adversary will be contentious, we may set this evidence aside, having enough without it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 163. In the next Century we have abundant Proof, and first I produced St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose, Who</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> confesses, <hi>pag.</hi> 53.) <hi>teaches Tithes to be due by God's Law.</hi> And indeed the Two Testimonies which were cited out of him before, are very full to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:200297:122"/> that purpose, <hi>viz. That it is the work of a Christian to pay Tithes,</hi> That <hi>the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us so to do;</hi> That <hi>we must do it faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and of the best, and of all our gains;</hi> That <hi>God hath reserved the Tenth to himself, and it is not lawful to detain it.</hi> Nothing can be plainer: but <hi>T. E.</hi> (who must seem to say something) objects, that I put in the word <hi>[Now]</hi> and yet St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> his sense is, that God doth require it <hi>now,</hi> he <hi>commands</hi> it <hi>[in the Present Tense]</hi> and commands <hi>us</hi> Christians to pay Tithes; so that the word <hi>[now]</hi> is implied, and makes no alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the sense, nor will it hurt me to leave it quite out. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He objects (out of Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>) that he fetches his proof from the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law; I Answer, He brings in a Text out of <hi>Moses</hi> Law, containing the Blessings promised to those who justly pay Tithes, and the Curse to those who detain them, but as a motive only, not a proof: and since he looked on the Duty as moral and obligatory to Christians (as many Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties written in <hi>Moses</hi> Law are) it is not of less force, either as it is a Precept or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, for being writ there; and though there be Ceremonial Rites annnexed to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Duties in that Law, yet take the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies off, and as well the Precepts as the Promises and Threatnings are in Force still; and though we do not claim Tithes by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that Law as 'tis Ceremonial, yet as far as Tithes are Moral, as far as that Law confirms the Divine approbation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:200297:122"/> so far it strengthens our claim and teaches us not to give less, and a Christian that justly pays Tithes without the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies then Annexed (in St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) hath a right to all the Blessings then promised to that Duty, and therefore he cited those Texts. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He doubts of the Quotations whether they be genuine, but all he can say is, <hi>That</hi> Ambrose <hi>his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons are by</hi> Perkins <hi>accounted spurious;</hi> which is very rashly done of that Author, and for a very frivolous reason, <hi>viz.</hi> because some of the same are found in <hi>Augustin</hi>'s Sermons; but then these two, 33 and 34, are none of that kind; yet if they had, it had not much abated of their Worth, nothing being more usual than for the genuine Work of one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be found under the name of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his Exposition of the Creed is found in St. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s Tomes, and under his name, and yet is the genuine work of <hi>Ruffinus.</hi> Besides, Dr. <hi>James,</hi> one far more exact than Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> reckons up which Sermons of St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> are not genuine in his censure of the Fathers, <hi>p.</hi> 28. <hi>viz.</hi> the 3, 14, 31, 32, 47, 50, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but he doth not account these two in that number; nay Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> himself (apt enough to Question all Quotations that agree not to his opinion) makes no exception against these two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, a sufficient sign they are genuine: So that we conclude St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> also is a good Witness for the Opinion of the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of Tithes, and the practice in his time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:200297:123"/> to be grounded upon that principle, <hi>An.</hi> 380.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 164. About the same time is <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius,</hi> who, as I noted, saith, <hi>The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture exhorts the people to give the Priests First-Fruits, Oblations, and other things for their Maintenance.</hi> This Quotation <hi>T. E.</hi> cannot deny, but yet strives to evade it by saying, <hi>First,</hi> That Tithes are not mentioned; but since the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers generally use this word for Tithes (as I have proved before) this is the same thing under another name. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He saith, <hi>He is certain no Scripture of the New Testament doth thus exhort the people.</hi> By which reply I am very <hi>certain</hi> he never saw the place in <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> who there Quotes a Text out of the New Testament; yet this blind and bold Censurer of Authors he never read, makes himself ridiculous by guessing that <hi>He must necessarily be understood to speak this with Relation to the</hi> Levitical <hi>Law,</hi> whereas <hi>Epiphanius</hi> there Quotes the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. 7. only, and no other. <hi>The Divine Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture saith to the Pastors, because of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual employment about the people, and their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent service in Ecclesiastical Administrations, Who feedeth a Flock?</hi> &amp;c. (citing the place at large) <hi>That it might secure the Bishops and Priests from wanting fitting provision, it exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the People,</hi> &amp;c. (as before). A little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he adds that the Priests have Right to there First-Fruits and Oblations; and that some who needed them not for themselves,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:200297:123"/> yet took them of the people, and gave them to the poor. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As for Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s large Objection out of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> I have fully answered it before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. and am not at leisure <hi>actum agere.</hi> So that I conclude <hi>Epiphanius</hi> thought Ministers of the Gospel had a Right to that which he calls <hi>First-Fruits,</hi> i. e. <hi>Tithes,</hi> even by the Scripture of the New Testament, and that they were paid in obedience to the Exhortations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which shews in his time they were own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be due <hi>Jure Divino.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 166. St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> is my next Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, against whose evidence <hi>T. E.</hi> hath only a few slight conjectures. And here that I may not be like him, I will freely confess I have discovered a mistake in my former Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, by consulting the Original, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which I shall now rectifie it: St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi> in that 35 Hom. on <hi>Genesis,</hi> (which neither <hi>Perkins</hi> nor the Library-keeper count spurious) is speaking of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s paying Tithes, <hi>Whence even now he</hi> (i. e. <hi>Abraham) is become a Tutor to all to express much gratitude, and to bring in the First-Fruits (Primitias</hi> and <hi>Decimas</hi> saith the old Latin Version) <hi>of what God gives us.</hi> And since he calls <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Tithes</hi> by the name of <hi>First-Fruits</hi> (as I noted before) no doubt he is so to be understood here, <hi>viz.</hi> That Christians ought to learn of <hi>Abraham</hi> to express their Gratitude by the Oblation of such <hi>First-Fruits</hi> as he offered, <hi>viz. Tithe of all.</hi> And in like manner he is
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:200297:124"/> to be understood in another genuine Homily, where exhorting Christians to build and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow Churches in the Country that their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours may be blessed, he saith, <hi>Is it not a small thing out of all thy Fruits, to take a part for God, and First-Fruits in the first place, this being profitable for the Husband-man's prosperity?</hi> Hom. 18. in <hi>Act.</hi> Tom. 4. p. 716. where he makes First-Fruits to be God's part, and a settled Dowry for the Church, as may be seen at large by consulting the place: And to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure us these First-Fruits were not to be less than a Tenth, he saith elsewhere, <hi>Oh what a shame is this! that what was no great matter among the Jews, should be pretended so among Christians. If then it was a dangerous thing to fail of giving Tithes, know it is more dangerous now.</hi> in <hi>Ephes.</hi> Serm. 4. Tom. 3.784. where we see he accounts it shameful and sinful for Christians to give less than a Tenth. And for the place which Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> and <hi>T. E.</hi> both do abuse, I will give it at large out of the Original to shame them, and clear my Position: <hi>When the Artificers sells any thing of his Art, let him pay [a Tithe, or] a First-Fruit</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Philo</hi>'s word for Tithing as I have shewed) <hi>of Honorary acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of it unto God; Let him cast a small part to him, for I require no great matter, but so much as the Jewish Infants in Religion loaden with many evils paid, let us that expect Heaven do so much; I speak not this as making a Law, or forbidding to give more, but requiring that less than a Tenth be not consecrated; and not the Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:200297:124"/> only but the Buyer must do this. This Law also they must observe in their profits who are pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors of Fields. This must be observed by all that gather any just encrease.</hi> Hom. 43. in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> Tom. 3. p. 53. And is not this a plain proof that (though he do not fix the proportion of a Tenth, so as it might not be exceeded, yet) he requires that none should give less, and calls it a Law to be observed by all? Nor was the Tenth named only as an Example to excite Christian Charity, but plainly as the lowest measure of a Christians absolute Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, insomuch that even in his Daies the very Clergy murmured, if the people did not offer their Tithes, as he notes, <hi>Hom.</hi> 44. in <hi>Matth.</hi> We conclude therefore that St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> looks upon it as a Duty now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon Christians to pay Tithes or First-Fruits, and though they may give more than a Tenth, it is shameful, dangerous and unlawful to give less. Which he thought dangerous to the Soul, with respect to God's Law, and consequently esteemed Tithes to be due <hi>Jure Divino.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to clear this further, as to St. <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi>'s Opinion, I shall add two new Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of two of his Eminent Schollars, who as they had learned from him, held it lawful for Christian Ministers to receive Tithes, and the Peoples Duty to pay them. <hi>First, Isidore Pelusiota,</hi> who in his Epistle to Count <hi>Herminus</hi> saith, <hi>Thou dost rightly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God in giving us the first of thy Fruits, and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:200297:125"/> returning the Tithes of the encrease of thy Land unto him that gave it; by which means thou shalt long enjoy thy Estate, reserving sufficient for thy own need at present, and preparing for thy self Eternal joy hereafter.</hi> Isid. Peleus. <hi>Epist. Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Ep.</hi> 317. How different was this Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from our modern Fanaticks! They cry out as if it were disallowed by God, and a damnable Sin to pay Tithes; He saith it is a right way of Honouring God, a means to procure his Blessing here, and a Duty so pleasing to the Lord that it shall be rewarded with Life everlasting hereafter; so that here is an undeniable proof both for Opinion and Practice too from one of St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi>'s Schollars and great admirers. <hi>Secondly, John Cassian</hi> was another of his Schollars (who as the former, doth generally imitate his Masters Doctrine.) And he also plainly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts the Right, and declares the practice of Annual Tithing: For in his 21 <hi>Collat.</hi> He mentions one <hi>Theonas</hi> coming to an old Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot named <hi>John, (Carrying</hi> (saith he) <hi>his Religious gifts amongst other Possessors, who crouded in, to offer the Tithes or First-Fruits of their Estates, to the aforesaid Old Man,</hi> cap. 1. pag. 942. and a little after <hi>Cassian</hi> saies, <hi>It was the Custom of this</hi> Theonas <hi>to pay the Tithes of his encrease</hi> every year <hi>to the Houfe of the Ministry.</hi> cap. 8. p. 945. Here the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of an Annual payment is so clear, that Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> confesses it; but to undervalue and evade it all he can, he saies, <hi>First,</hi> That <hi>Cassian</hi> writ this, <hi>An.</hi> 430. He writ it indeed
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:200297:125"/> about that time, but <hi>Theonas</hi> was very old in <hi>Cassian</hi>'s Youth, and yet this relation of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> paying Tithes, was when the said <hi>Theonas</hi> was newly married, and his Parents married him very young. <hi>Cass.</hi> Collat. 21. cap. 1. Yea and the Church Histories assure us that Abbot <hi>John,</hi> who received Tithes of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> lived about fifty years before <hi>Cassian,</hi> so that this Testimony relates to the Times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the year 380. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, <hi>It was given to the Abbot as Treasurer for the poor.</hi> I reply, that Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>pag.</hi> 78. takes Distribution of Tenths to the Poor, to be meant of Monasteries, <hi>For the Monks</hi> (saith he) <hi>were usually called</hi> Pauperes, <hi>and were so indeed by their Vow.</hi> I add that these Monks <hi>Cassian</hi> speaks of did really live up to that Vow, for they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the World and would have no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, so that the Abbot received them for his poor Monks, and what they needed not, he who also had renounced all propriety, gave away in Alms (but the Case of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent married Clergy will not allow this.) However his receiving them shews his Right, and his distributing them his Charity. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> pretends <hi>these Abbots were not properly of the Ministring Clergy:</hi> Which is (I doubt a wilful, I am sure) a gross mistake, since <hi>Sozomen</hi> speaking of two of these Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots, <hi>Piammon,</hi> and this very Abbot <hi>John,</hi> saith, <hi>They were Presbyters, and very reverently performed the Office of the Priest-hood.</hi> Soz. <hi>Eccl. Hist. l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 29. <hi>mihi p.</hi> 395. and the House
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:200297:126"/> in which they lived, and to which the people brought their Tithes is called <hi>Diaconia, The House of the Ministry:</hi> Wherefore this is a clear Testimony of a Customary annual pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tithes to a Priest, long before the year 400. and in that Discourse of <hi>Cassian</hi>'s, he brings in the said Priest declaring the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tithes to be an act of Piety, and pleasing to God; only he thinks that they who would come up to the highest measures of Christianity, which those Primitive Monks aspired to, should give more, yea should sell all and follow Christ. And now I shall only note how foully <hi>T.E.</hi> hath belied Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in saying, <hi>He is positive for the first four hundred years:</hi> since the very words he cites out of <hi>Selden</hi> do grant, <hi>There was use and payment of Tithes towards the end of the first four hundred years;</hi> and though he pretend it was not sooner, yet Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s negative against so many clear Testimonies of the Fathers from <hi>Irenaeus</hi> downward, is of no force or value, for we have now proved both Opinion and Practice from the year 170.</p>

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 168. St. <hi>Hierom</hi> lived towards the end of the first four hundred years, and Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> grants Use and Payment in his time, so that he ought to allow my proofs out of him: But <hi>T. E.</hi> resolves to grant nothing, and therefore he first slips two of my Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions out of St. <hi>Hierom:</hi> The former proving that there were so large First-Fruits given to Gospel Ministers in his daies, that they laied
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:200297:126"/> them up in their Houses as a store to live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the other declaring, that the Clergy had Tithes so plentifully paid, that they might well spare some to the relief of the poor Monks and Hermits. But these, it seems, were not worth <hi>T. E</hi>'s notice, or rather he knew not how to answer them. The first he mentions is a Quotation he finds in <hi>Selden,</hi> and though he pick it up at second hand there, <hi>Hist. Tithes, p.</hi> 47. yet he is so bold to tell his Reader, I give not <hi>Hierom</hi>'s words fairly, and pervert his sense: whereas I transcribed what was to the purpose, and very fairly cited my Author for any that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to see the rest, which doth more fully confirm my Opinion; for St. <hi>Hierom</hi> having sold his own Estate, is perswading other Clergy-men to do the like, and to live as he did of the Lord's portion, saying, <hi>If I be the Lord's Part, and a Portion (Funiculus</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, his Portion, his part was Theirs, whereupon he himself had quitted his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, Possession, and had no more worldly estate than the Priests and <hi>Levites</hi> of old, but lived of Tithes and Oblations, as they did,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:200297:127"/> and if this was not so plentiful a Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance as Lay-men enjoyed, yet if it would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him necessaries, he would be content; and as Christ was Crucified naked, he would follow him stripped of all Temporal Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. This is the true sense of the place, and nothing is more agreeable to St. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s principles, practice, and the Genius of those Times. And he plainly affirms he did live of Tithes and Oblations as plainly as he doth, that he had now no Temporal inheritance; and he mentions the Priests and <hi>Levites,</hi> only to shew Christ had made a like Provision for his Ministers, as God made for those, nor doth he say, <hi>I live</hi> as Priests and <hi>Levites</hi> lived of Tithes: But <hi>as a Priest or</hi> Levite, <hi>I do live of Tithes,</hi> which admits of no Evasion; for he doth not (as <hi>T. E.</hi> pretends) say, he was a <hi>Levite;</hi> but he saies positively he lived of Tithes, and in that was like a <hi>Levite.</hi> And yet I must tell my ignorant Adversary, that the Clergy, and especially such who (as St. <hi>Hierom</hi>) lived in Monasteries, are often stiled <hi>Levites, The Religious are reckoned</hi> (saith <hi>Al.

Contemporary with him was St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> out of whom I produced ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proofs: <hi>First,</hi> out of his 48 Homily (which is not censured by <hi>Rivet</hi> nor by <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi>) I shewed how he affirms, <hi>That their Fore-fathers were blessed with plenty for paying Tithes.</hi> This place <hi>T. E</hi> not finding in <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> he rambles up and down to make some shew of answering, but alas he goes about by meer conjectures to prove, that was not, which the men of those Ages in their genuine writings do plainly affirm to have been. <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>'s Monthly Offerings as himself assures us (in the next words to those cited by <hi>T.E.</hi>) were bestowed, <hi>In feeding the poor, burying the dead, in relieving Orphans, Bed-rid old men, Ship-wrackt persons, and for those who were condemned to the Mines, to Islands, and Prisons, only for the cause of Religion.</hi> Apol. <hi>cap.</hi> 39. So that he is speaking of Alms for the Poor, and can any man <hi>fairly collect</hi> from hence, that because the poor had Alms, therefore the Clergy had no Tithes? yet this is the Quakers Logick. The place he
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:200297:128"/> cites out of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> I have shewed to be a plain proof for Tithes, and only note here that <hi>T.E.</hi> hath knavishly left out these words <hi>[of our Patrimony]</hi> which may be seen by looking upon the same Sentence in his 161 Page, where he hath <hi>Tenths of our Patrimony:</hi> And though my Adversary be so bold to say here, <hi>That Tithes were not paid in</hi> Cyprian<hi>'s time;</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> (who knew far more than he) saith of the same time, <hi>For any use of payment in his time, I was not so bold to make the Negative, that no Tithes were paid.</hi> Review p. 460. and nothing makes <hi>T. E.</hi> bolder than he, but his blindness. The pretence of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> is baffled before; and though Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> would perswade us he was no witness for Tithes, yet he confesses, <hi>That</hi> Epiphani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us <hi>his Testimony seems not sufficiently to prove no use of Tithes in the</hi> African <hi>Church, no nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in the Western or European.</hi> Review p. 461. How impertinent therefore is this Quaker to bring <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> who lived in the Eastern Church, to prove no Tithes in <hi>Africa,</hi> where St. <hi>Augustine</hi> lived, who affirms in an undoubted part of his Works, that they had been paid from the Daies of their Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>i. e.</hi> long before his time? And that so often repeated Sentence of <hi>Willet</hi>'s, is a great error, for I may now upon <hi>Augustine</hi>'s own Testimony, and the evidence of many other Fathers, justifie the contrary for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Truth, <hi>viz. That in</hi> Augustine<hi>'s time it was a general Law and Custom in the Church, that Tithes should be paid.</hi>

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 170. Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> confesseth that a Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tithes in the <hi>African</hi> Church may be collected out of St. <hi>Angustine</hi>'s Sermons, from thence therefore I brought a large and full proof both for Opinion and Practice. But <hi>T. E.</hi> would fain shuffle this off too, by Questioning first, whether this 219 Sermon be genuine: Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> only saith, <hi>It hath been doubted whether it be his or no.</hi> And I pray what Book of sacred or other Writer almost, but hath been doubted of? The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of divers Books of Scripture have been doubted of, and some have doubted of the evidence of sense; shall we therefore reject the Scripture, or refuse to trust our Senses? I am sure there is no reason to doubt of this Sermons being genuine, for <hi>Caesarius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Arles,</hi> in the next Century, cites divers Passages of this Sermon, bringing them in with <hi>Dixit Augustinus.</hi> Caesar. Arel. <hi>Hom.</hi> 37. in the same manner also it is cited by Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Bede,</hi> and in that Ancient Book called <hi>Statuta Synodorum</hi> cited by <hi>Selden.</hi> Hist. Tith. p. 210. and by many others; and is it likely a false piece could so early be fathered on St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and so generally be owned, and none discover it? Neither do <hi>Perkins</hi> or <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet</hi> reckon this among his spurious Sermons, though they are apt to reckon more to be spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious than they need, as I could prove if there were occasion. Besides the Doctrine of this Sermon agrees with what the same Father saith in other parts of his Works: As that
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:200297:129"/> 195 Sermon, where he bids them <hi>Pay Tithes every year to the Church and to the Poor, of all the Fruits they gather,</hi> and Serm. 205. <hi>Let us give some part, and if you ask, what part? I answer, a Tenth.</hi> The like Doctrine he hath in his Enarration of the 146 <hi>Psal.</hi> and in several other places; what cause then is there to suspect this only? Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> tells <hi>T. E.</hi> that the very words of this Sermon are in the counterfeit Treatise falsly attributed to St. <hi>Augustine</hi> and inscribed <hi>de rectitudine catholicae conversationis.</hi> I answer it is the more likely this Sermon is true; for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeitor of that Treatise did not know how to colour over his false Ware better, than by putting in some Sentences known to be St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s own, and yet (having compared these two) I do assure the Reader, that though there be much the same sense with this Sermon, yet there are but a very few of the words of it there, not three lines toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and those not in the method and order of the Sermon: So that we conclude the Sermon is Genuine, and scarce any piece of St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s can be so fully proved to be his. In the Second place <hi>T. E.</hi> flies to the words and Sense, that he may find out some cavil there, but all in vain, for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he charges me with omitting somewhat which he finds in <hi>Selden;</hi> was that a fault? I cited mine from the Author himself, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested my Reader to peruse the whole Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, so that it cannot be imagined I would have any part of it concealed. As for the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:200297:129"/> Texts of the Old Testament, <hi>Exod.</hi> xxii. <hi>Prov.</hi> iii. <hi>Malach.</hi> iii. I have Quoted them all my self, and proved by reason and great Authority, that as far as concerns a Tenth part, they oblige Christians now; and surely <hi>T. E.</hi> will not say all proofs out of the Old Testament are part of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law. And for his Allegations out of <hi>Selden</hi> about Relieving the Poor by Tithes, it is evident that is spoken only with relation to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable use the Clergy made of what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in God's and their own Right; for their Piety was such, that out of the Churches Treasury they voluntarily maintained the Poor, who would have wanted that relief, if Tithes had not been so fully and plentifully paid; and this charitable use of Tithes was a popular Argument to perswade them to pay Tithes exactly and freely. But still St. <hi>Augustine</hi> makes the Priest the receiver of Tithes, <hi>Thou shalt give that</hi> (saith he) <hi>to the wicked Souldier which thou wilt not give to the Priest:</hi> yea both <hi>Selden</hi> and <hi>T.E.</hi> strive to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal this, for where they break off—<hi>Pay the Poor their Tribute</hi>—(there St. <hi>Augustine</hi> adds) —<hi>and offer the Priest his Offering:</hi> Besides, 'tis sure these Tithes were not prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally intended as Alms, because St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> admonishes the People to give Alms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides out of the Nine parts, <hi>Let him pay his Tithes</hi> — (there again <hi>Selden</hi> and <hi>T. E.</hi> break off, but it follows) —<hi>and out of the Nine parts let him take care to give Alms to the Poor.</hi> Aug. <hi>ibid.</hi> 'Tis they therefore who
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:200297:130"/> are guilty of concealing, and not I: But <hi>T. E.</hi> hath one peculiar Objection against this Sermon, <hi>viz.</hi> that the word <hi>[Promere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri]</hi> which he Translates <hi>[to Merit]</hi> is found in it; which shews his gross ignorance of the Fathers stile, and the innocent sense they used such Phrases in: for St. <hi>Augustine</hi> in this very Sermon, saith, <hi>Redde quia nasci meruisti; Pay, because thou hast obtained the favour to be born.</hi> Not in the sense of <hi>[Meriting]</hi> for how could a man <hi>Merit</hi> before he had a Being? yea, that bitter Papist <hi>Stapylton</hi> confesses, <hi>That if any of the Ancients use the word</hi> [Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mereri] <hi>they did not mean any more by it than bare</hi> obtaining. <hi>Stap.</hi> Serm. <hi>Fer.</hi> 5. post Pasch. So that St. <hi>Augustine</hi> means no more than that the Piety and Charity of Paying Tithes would procure a man a glorious Reward in Heaven, and being a good fruit of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, a man might hope thereby to obtain a Pardon of his former Covetousness, since now he did so really testifie his Repenting thereof. There is indeed a Mystery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in <hi>T. E.</hi> but there is none at all in St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s Sermon, which is so illustrious and undeniable a Proof, that we may see the Enemies of Tithes do try all sorts of Tricks to escape the Force of it, but in despite of all, it remains a full and Authentick proof of the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of Tithes, and shews that was St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s Opinion also.</p>

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 172. The light now begins to startle our Quaker, and when <hi>Prosper</hi> is brought in, he cannot deny but giving Tithes began to be frequent in his Daies: the Truth is so plain in this Testimony that yielding the matter of Fact, he seeks about for some dirt to throw in the Authors Face. To <hi>Perkins</hi> he goes, and in his 69 Page (for we can trace our Retailer) he finds <hi>Prosper</hi> cited as saying, <hi>Orationibus Sanctorum me expiari ab omni Peccato posse confido:</hi> and hence he charges this Holy Father as corrupt, and one that had departed from the Purity of the Gospel. Which were it true in that one point, it doth not follow but he might very faithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relate the usage of paying Tithes in his Time. But indeed the charge is false, as will appear by considering the occasion and the words which <hi>Prosper</hi> did write. Know then, that <hi>Prosper</hi> having collected a Book out of the sayings of the Patriarchs, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Apostles, in his Rhetorical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion he saith, that since he was yet under the Law of Sin, he hath offered up in the Temple of God a Sacrifice of the Fat things of the Patriarchs, Prophets, and Apostles (meaning the Sentences of his Book) for the Sin of his Soul, and the cleansing of his whole man, <hi>And I have Vowed</hi> (saith he) <hi>a Confession and offered up a Burnt-Offering upon the Altar of a contrite Heart, not without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense of the Prayers of all Saints</hi> (or holy men.) <hi>Quibus me expiari,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>By which I trust I
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:200297:131"/> may be expiated from all sin▪</hi> in fin. libr. p. 182. Now <hi>(Quibus)</hi> takes in all, by observing the sayings of the Patriarchs, Prophets, and Apostles, by his Confession and Contrition of Heart and the Prayers of all Saints or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Men, he hopes to obtain his Pardon, and he seems not at all to mean it of the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, but of living Saints, for in the next Sentence but one he saith, <hi>Let every one of my pious Readers pray for me.</hi> Prosp. <hi>ibid.</hi> And his other works shew he was Orthodox in this point, and that it is a meer slander; for not to cite many, that one place may serve where he saith, <hi>Every Prayer not made by Christ, not only cannot expiate Sin, but is it self a very sin.</hi> Prosp. <hi>exp. in</hi> Psal. 108. p. 626. <hi>Prosper</hi> therefore was not corrupt in this Point, and he is a good witness, that Tithes were ordinarily paid in his time, which was a little after the end of the first four hundred years.</p>

Having now justified all my Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and shewed the falshood and folly of all the Objections made against them, it will be very entertaining to the Reader to look over <hi>T. E</hi>'s vain Triumph in this Page, who hath the pleasure of thinking he hath utterly confuted them all: But I am not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for his Dreams; if those who are fit to judge in this matter, do believe I have fairly made it appear that the most pure and Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Fathers did hold that Tithes were due to the Gospel Ministers <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> and that
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:200297:131"/> they were paid upon that principle as well as the state of things would bear, from the time of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Origen,</hi> in most parts of the then Christian World; <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi> St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> and <hi>Prosper</hi> witness this for the Western Church; <hi>Origen, Cyprian,</hi> St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine, Isidore,</hi> and <hi>Cassian</hi> for the <hi>African;</hi> the Apostolical Canons, St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> for the Eastern Church. And though these Fathers all did oppose Jewish Ceremonies, and St. <hi>Hierom</hi> particularly saies, <hi>I pronounce openly and boldly that Jewish Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are Pernicious and Deadly to Christians.</hi> Hieron. Aug. <hi>Ep.</hi> 11. yet he and all the rest assert and plead for Tithes. Nor can our Adversaries bring one Father who did oppose this general Opinion, or reprove the practice as Jewish, or unlawful; none blamed the people for paying, or the Priests for receiving them, which shews it was the general and unanimous Opinion of the Church for the first four hundred years: and since they lived so near the Apostles time, and knew their Traditions better than we do, and were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to give us the true sense of their Writings than any modern Interpreters; it is a mighty confirmation to all sober men, that this is the true sense of Scripture concerning this matter, and strongly justifies my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in the last chapter. As for the following Ages the Confession of our Adversaries is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to assure us, the Church varied not from this Opinion and Practice; but if it were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful I could deduce the History through every
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:200297:132"/> Age, and after <hi>Isidore, Cassian,</hi> and <hi>Prosper,</hi> might be added <hi>Caesarius Arelatensis,</hi> (right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly placed by <hi>Baronius, Ann.</hi> 502.) who cites and approves St. <hi>Augustine</hi> his Opinion, and reckons Tithes to be assigned by God to the Church; <hi>Hom.</hi> 2. <hi>de Eleem.</hi> being frequent in his exhortations to pay them, <hi>Hom.</hi> 14. <hi>&amp;c.

It hath been a usuall trick of all our Sectaries to stick the odious Names of Popery upon any thing they would expose unto publick Hatred, and that is one of <hi>T. E</hi>'s. artifices with Tithes, which he often affirms had their Original from Popery; which slander is sufficiently confuted by these manifest proofs of the most early and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:200297:132"/> Fathers, holding them due long before Popery came in. And though the Quaker dare not directly charge the Primitive Church with Popery so soon, yet (by most wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perverting some passages of Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi>) he throws dirt upon the purest Ages, and suggests they were not free from Popish Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions; and this, out of that very Book which <hi>Perkins</hi> writ to prove, that Popery was not Antient nor Universal (as I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Introduction) but I shall briefly run over the particulars &amp; shew how he abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> as well as those Times. <hi>First, T. E.</hi> saith. <hi>About the year of Christ</hi> 200. (<hi>as early as</hi> Origen) <hi>Prayers, Offerings, and Sacrifices for the Dead began to be in use in the Church, and he cites</hi> Tertullian. <hi>lib. de cor. militis.</hi> These are neither <hi>Perkins</hi> his word nor sence, but the Quakers own (though he saith he will not speak his own sense) For <hi>Perkins</hi> saith, <hi>There were no Prayers, Oblations, nor Sacrifices for the Dead before the year</hi> 200. Tertullian <hi>makes the first mention of them.</hi> He doth not say <hi>they began to be used in the Church, about the year</hi> 200. yea within six lines he saith, <hi>it was</hi> 400 <hi>years after Christ before the Antients thought it lawful to Pray for all the Dead; and then (he saith) they knew not whether those Prayers would do them any good or no, and that if the Antients said any thing to this purpose, to be sure they spoke not in the Popish Sense, pag.</hi> 97. As for <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> he only mentions <hi>Oblations for the Dead,</hi> and never names Prayers at all; now Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> saith, <hi>Oblations for the Dead were
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:200297:133"/> not at first Sacrifices of Expiation, but Euchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical only, pag.</hi> 101. And when he speaks of Prayers for the Dead he likewise saith, <hi>They were at first only Praises and Thanksgivings in which the names of the Martyrs were read, pag.</hi> 99. Finally <hi>Perkins</hi> concludes, <hi>That Prayers for the Dead in the Popish Sense were not received by the Antients.</hi> And would any man but <hi>T. E.</hi> have pretended to speak <hi>Perkins</hi> his Sense, when <hi>Perkins</hi> denys the Church was so early corrupted with Popish Praying for the Dead? And the Quaker out of him affirms the contrary. <hi>Secondly,</hi> a like cheat he is guilty of in reference to Purgatory, as I have noted in the Introduction. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He pretends also that Invocation of Saints crept into the Church much about the year 200. But <hi>Perkins</hi> saith expresly, <hi>There can no Invocation of the Dead be shewed in the Church for</hi> 350. <hi>years after Christ,</hi> pag. 89. But we have proved Tithes much Older than that; and note here that <hi>Perkins</hi> brings most of the Patrons of Tithes to confute this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Saints, <hi>viz. Origen, Ambrose, Epiphanius,</hi> and <hi>Chrysostom, Hierom,</hi> and <hi>Augustine. pag.</hi> 90. So that it was a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition of the Vulgar, not an Opinion of the Church, nor are the flourishes of Poets or the Rhetorical Figures of Orators to be brought in for solid Arguments; so that Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> confesses that, <hi>the Worship of the Saints of which the Fathers generally spake, was not Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worship or Adoration, pag.</hi> 97. So that it was not the Popish Worship of Saints.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:200297:133"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As for Reliques, <hi>Perkins</hi> in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry next words (to those cited by <hi>T. E.</hi> viz. <hi>This Veneration began</hi> 300. <hi>years after Christ</hi>) adds — <hi>But the Church did not Worship them with Adoration or Genu-flection for</hi> 600. <hi>years, pag.</hi> 81. Therefore he did not think the Church corrupted with this point of Popery so early as our Testimonies about Tithes. <hi>Fifthly, Perkins</hi> mentions Pilgrimages as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning <hi>Ann.</hi> 320. but he saith also, that they were not undertaken then as a part of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship, but for confirmation of the Faith. He adds, <hi>indeed afterwards it was changed into a part of Gods Worship;</hi> but <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> names no time, and <hi>T. E.</hi> adds of his own head, that this was about the end of that Century; whereas <hi>Perkins</hi> brings the sound Fathers of that time expresly reproving it in that Popish Sense, and one <hi>Hildebertus</hi> also who lived <hi>Ann.</hi> 1090. So that <hi>Perkins</hi> did not think this Popish corruption so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as the Quaker pretends. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Though <hi>Perkins</hi> (out of <hi>Platina</hi>) say <hi>Chrism</hi> was instituted by Pope <hi>Sylvester, Ann.</hi> 330. (and I can prove the Primitive <hi>Chrism</hi> much elder) yet he saith in the same Page, <hi>The Chrism of the ancients differs from</hi> the Popish Unction p. 184. And having reckoned up several Differences, he tells us <hi>Hales</hi> affirms, this Sacrement was not instituted till the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of <hi>Melda.</hi> So that this is another slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The Extreme Unction which <hi>Innocent</hi> decreed <hi>Ann.</hi> 404. was not the same with the Popish; for all men might use that,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:200297:134"/> but none but a Priest make use of this, <hi>pag.</hi> 201. And there again <hi>Perkins</hi> shews the difference between the Primitive and the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Unction <hi>pag.</hi> 202. So that he did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Church then was stained with this piece of Popery. <hi>Eighthly,</hi> That Monkish life which <hi>Perkins</hi> saith began <hi>Ann.</hi> 230. or rather <hi>Ann,</hi> 300. had none of the Habits or other usages of the Popish Monks, as he tells us <hi>pag.</hi> 226. and <hi>the Old Monks differed from the Popish in the Foundation of their Religion, p.</hi> 227. And he saith, <hi>The Monkish life now in use was condemned by the Antients, pag.</hi> 228. all which <hi>T. E.</hi> could not but see, and therefore he is wilfully dishonest in charging this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish corruption on the Primitive Church, as if it were Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> his Sense. <hi>Lastly, Perkins</hi> saith not that <hi>Caelibate began to be preacht up by or before the year</hi> 300. But <hi>the Mariage of Priests was free before the year</hi> 300. And for the Decree he mentions as forbidding their Marriage <hi>Ann.</hi> 380. <hi>Perkins</hi> himself affirms the very Epistle, in which it is contained, to be a Forgery, <hi>pag.</hi> 33. Therefore he did not think this so early a Corruption as <hi>T. E.</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends. And now let the Reader judge of this Quakers Honesty, who hath searcht this Book of <hi>Perkins</hi> over and over, and so cannot well be supposed to falsify his plain sense so notoriously out of ignorance; for he must needs know that Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> his whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign is to free the Primitive Fathers from these very Corruptions which <hi>T. E.</hi> (out of him) pretends to charge them with. What will
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:200297:134"/> this man stick at to serve an ill cause? But since his vile dealing is so palpable, and his Charge of Popery on these times (even in <hi>Perkins</hi> his Judgment who is apt to lay it too soon) is so very false; I conclude that Tithes were generally asserted and paid long before Popery came in.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. PAg. 176. We should proceed to the Testimony of Councils, but that the Quaker for want of better Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and to fill up two or three pages, racks those words, <hi>The earliest days of Christianity,</hi> and <hi>the first Christians,</hi> to make them confess a contradiction of his own making, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the Apostles times; though he well knew I was speaking of the Primitive Church in the Ages following; this had been designed Equivocation in one of the Carnal men, and no Cole black enough to mark it with. But I shall let it pass as one of the Symptomes of a sinking Cause, and put my assertion in other words, <hi>viz.</hi> That since I have proved Tithes were paid in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, long before they were enjoyned by any Humane Law Ecclesiastical or Civil; it follows that the Primitive Christians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved they were Obliged to pay them by the Law of God. To this <hi>T. E.</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects p. 178. that they might pay them by vertue of Tradition, even as they made Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the Dead (which <hi>T. E.</hi> falsly calls Praying and Sacrificing for the Dead) upon the account of Tradition only. I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, the Fathers do always carefully distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:200297:135"/> the usages grounded upon Tradition, from those grounded upon the Law of God; but neither <hi>Tertullian,</hi> nor any other who reckons up the usages grounded on Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doth ever mention Tithes in those Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues, but on the contrary, they plainly cite Scripture as the ground on which Tithes were established, and expounded it so as to declare them due by the Law of God; which they never do in case of a Rite only grounded upon Tradition; so that we may conclude that the Christians of Old grounded their practice upon the same foundation that their Doctors grounded their Opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Law of God.</hi> But if Tithes were a Tradition, according to St. <hi>Augustines</hi> Rule cited in my 84th. Page, they must be an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical Tradition, because we have shewed they were universally paied; and yet (as we shall shew) they owed not their beginning to any Council. Now if the Apostles (who were guided by an infallible Spirit) did deliver it certainly that the Tenth was the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which Christ required should be given for his Ministers Maintenance under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; this tradition being an Establishment of so much of the Divine Law as concerned the proportion, is a declaration still of their being due <hi>Jure Divino.</hi> And no judicious man will question but an Apostolical Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion delivered by word of mouth (supposing it be conveyed to us as certainly as a written Tradition) would be and is of equal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with what is delivered by writing: but
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:200297:135"/> this I speak only upon <hi>T. E</hi>'s. Supposition that Tithes might be grounded upon some unwritten Tradition.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. PAg. 179. I come now to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of Councils, and First I produced those Canons which do not ordain Tithes shall be paid, but supposing them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready paid, do direct the Distribution of them, and order other matters about them. And since the first Councils found them actually paid, and made no Law di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, for that the Primitive Christians pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them before any Humane Law enjoyned them; we may conclude they were directed by some other Higher Law, that is they were guided unto this practice by the Law of God. And withall let it be noted, that the actual Payment of Tithes long before any Law of the Church prescribed it, doth abundantly prove that Opinion of the Jesuites and other Papists to be false, who hold Tithes to be meerly of Ecclesiastical Institution. But to come to my proofs, those Primitive Canons stiled the <hi>Apostolical</hi> Canons (in questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and mistaking of which <hi>T. E.</hi> hath so miserably shamed himself) which I have now proved the genuine products of the first three Centuries; these being written in Greek use (as I have shewed before) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> for Tithes, and do not only teach the People to carry those to the Bishops House, <hi>Can.</hi> 4. but declare that <hi>the Bishop shall have power over
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:200297:136"/> these Goods of the Church, and accordingly direct him how to distribute them so as still to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a liberal Maintenance for himself. Can.</hi> 38. and 41. And since <hi>Irenaeus, Origen,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Doctors, then taught that the Tenth was the least proportion in which these First-fruits were to be paid; we cannot suppose then less than a Tithe of all. And it is a grear confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apostolical Canons, in that a known and undoubted Council at <hi>Gangra An.</hi> 324. Ordains the same things in the case of these First-fruits or Tithes; <hi>T. E.</hi> indeed cannot find the name, but he may find the thing; for <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> which Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> (leaving out one of the words) odly Translates <hi>Offerings of Fruits,</hi> whereas I judge it more proper to interpret it <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Tribute of Fruits.</hi> These are by that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ordered to be given to and received by none but those of the Churches Ministers; and whoever did otherwise without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Bishop or his Curator, is declared accursed, <hi>Can.</hi> 7. And whoever dispenses them but the Bishop, is likewise there declared accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Can.</hi> 8. Which is a full proof of frequent payment then, since the Bishop had a Cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor on purpose to receive them, and also an evidence that they were paid in Kind out of the Fruits, and for the proportion the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers must be our guide, who had determined not less then a Tenth should be given; and doubtless in so pious an Age their Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was sufficient to fix that part. And therefore we may interpret, <hi>the</hi>

                  </gap>] <hi>things of the Church</hi> are more particularly described to be <hi>Rents of the Church</hi> (arising from dedicated Lands) and <hi>Fruits of the Fields</hi> (arising from Tithes) And these the Bishop is there ordered to take care rightly to dispense. Agreeable to this is that Canonical Epistle of <hi>Cyril</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to <hi>Domnus,</hi> which (though <hi>T.E.</hi> ridiculously think it a private Letter) is a part of the Canon Law of the Eastern Church, and there also <hi>the things of the Church</hi> are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed into <hi>Ecclesiastical Revenues and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of Fruits;</hi> and in the same Epistle we read of Stores laid up, and immovable pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, which are required to be preserved for the Church.

All these Canons though they name not Tithes, yet do shew a large provision was made for the Primitive Church; and that out of the Fruits of the Field, paid in kind to the Bishop for himself and his Clergy; and he that can think the proportion less than a Tithe, must also suppose the Primitive Christians worse than Jews, and must believe they gave little heed to what their Pastors taught them to be the Will and Mind of God: Which no man can do that knows any thing of the State of those Times.</p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:200297:137"/>
               <p>But here I must note <hi>T. E.</hi> cunningly slips a most considerable censure which the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Gangra</hi> passeth upon the Ancestors of our Quakers, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Eustathian</hi> Hereticks, <hi>Who</hi> (as these do now) <hi>forsook the Churches, met in Conventicles, and taught strange Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines there against the Church and its Rites and Habits, and finally pretending to be Saints, chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged to themselves the Ecclesiastical Tribute of Fruits, which</hi> (saith the Council) <hi>of old time were given to the Church:</hi> So that this Primitive Council condemns the Quakers Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, and their detaining the Churches Dues, even though they did not receive the Ministry thereof (which <hi>T. E.</hi> thinks to be so very unjust, <hi>pag.</hi> 108. &amp;c.) And it shews that the Churches Maintenance was not Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary, nor to be disposed as the <hi>Occupant</hi> pleased, and withal assures us that this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Provision was given to the Church long before the Celebration of this Council, and that the Practice was of long standing, <hi>An.</hi> 324. which will reach as high as <hi>Origen</hi> at least. This therefore my Adversary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals from his Quakers, who he hopes will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read my Book, and so never find out the Fraud of balking that which he cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>

Or can he or any other bring one proof for any Opinion or Practice where any other proportion is named? When he shews as much to prove it was an Eighth or a Twelfth, then he shall have liberty to brag: but till then, it is an idle vaunt to muster up the Names of many other Councils, which the meanest Smatterer might do out of any paul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Epitome: So that (whatever his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers think) this Retail of Names is no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his Learning, especially since he hath mistaken the very Dates of many of them, as I could prove if need were<note n="(a)" place="margin">Concil. 1. <hi>Carthag.

Again, how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdly doth he speak of the first General Council (as some calls it, saith <hi>T.

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:200297:138"/> they denied the Trinity of the Persons: But to let these pass, I assure <hi>T.

Al. <hi>Strom.</hi> 4. They paid them without any Human Law, and till that Piety and Zeal cooled, there was no need of such constraint: Councils were called not to order things that were right already, but to rectifie what was amiss; so that we cannot expect to meet with any Canons directly enjoyning Tithes, till the people began to neglect to pay them, and this very silence of Councils, as to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, argues all was right in that particular by vertue of God's Law.</p>

The Decree of that <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Council, <hi>An.</hi> 374. which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly enjoyns payment of Tithes (though I laid not much stress upon it before) yet is found in those Acts of <hi>Damasus,</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Order of the Ancient Church were Read in the Publick Assembly, <hi>Concil.</hi> 3.

               <p>By this it appears that Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> either wilfully curtailed this Canon, or else cited it out of some Abbreviator, and that shews <hi>T. E</hi>'s folly who goes about to correct a streight line by a crooked one, and mends my true Copy by an imperfect and false one. But for the Testimony it self, it doth wholly destroy both his and his Master's Hypothesis. For it makes payment of Tithes to be a matter
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:200297:140"/> of Religion anciently in use, and now begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be neglected, and therefore to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived; it Asserts that Gods Laws had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Tithes for Ministers of the Gospel, yea as an inheritance for them, to give them more leisure to attend their Offices; and that the Divine Laws enjoyned all people to pay them. And further affirms, That all Christians had for a long time paid them in obedience to these Laws, and that those who neglected it were guilty of breaking God's Law, and therefore they renew the Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by adding this Canon to the precedent Divine Law; and advising the Priests to use them charitably, that their Prayers might be more successful, they conclude with a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Excommunication against the diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient. And can any thing be more full for the <hi>Jus Divinum?</hi> Indeed the Tithe-Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an omits many of these passages which are clearest for the Divine Right, and labours with all imaginable Partiality to weaken the credit of the whole, but I hope to shew that his Objections will not effect his design: For whereas he Objects, <hi>First,</hi> That <hi>Isidore</hi> doth not mention this <hi>French</hi> Council, though he mentions others at <hi>Orleance, Arles,</hi> and <hi>Agatha;</hi> I answer, that <hi>Isidore</hi> omits many others as well as this, and scarce mentions any one so late as this, for the Fifth Council of <hi>Orleance</hi> was held several years before this of <hi>Mascon,</hi> and the last at <hi>Arles</hi> was <hi>An.</hi> 524. that of <hi>Agatha An.</hi> 506. so that <hi>Isidore</hi> might mention those which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:200297:140"/> his time, and yet not mention this, which (as some compute) was held but two years before he was made Bishop of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> Being therefore so late, and called in a Province so remote; his silence of it is no wonder: Especially since <hi>Gregory</hi> Bishop of <hi>Turon,</hi> a credible Historian, who lived at the time of this Council, mentions it at large, <hi>Histor.</hi> Franc. <hi>l.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 12. and <hi>c.</hi> 20. and from him Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> learns that <hi>Guntheran</hi> and all the Bishops of his Kingdom were present at it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Since most of the Compilers followed <hi>Isidore</hi> and one another; and none put out a compleat Collection of all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils till Fryar <hi>Crab;</hi> what wonder is it, if he first put it in its due place? And the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilers putting Canons of several Councils to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether under Titles without other method, omit many as well as this. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, <hi>pag.</hi> 65. out of <hi>Agobardus</hi> that, <hi>As to giving things, or Ordaining Churches, nothing is ever appointed in Synods, nothing Publickly Preached of Holy Fathers. For there was no need, a Religious Devotion being every where Fervent, and men being zealous of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to illustrate Churches.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> wonders how this can stand with the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Council at <hi>Mascon.</hi> I reply, That <hi>Agobardus</hi> by <hi>[Synods]</hi> there, means <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils,</hi> as plainly appears, if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how he brings in this Sentence, <hi>A man may know</hi> (saith he) <hi>what Councils have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in this matter, if he will read and turn them over; but some will not receive the</hi> French
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:200297:141"/>
                  <hi>Canons, nor those of other Provinces, because the Popes and Emperours Legates were not present in those Councils.</hi> But he goes on to advise men to think reverently even of Provincial Councils. And where there are no Canons of greater Synods (<hi>i. e.</hi> general Councils) there he would have them consult the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the Ancients, and to prefer their sense before their own Fancies, in regard these Provincial Canons were made agreeable to Scripture, and the Acts of their Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers [and then comes in the above cited Sentence] So that <hi>Agobardus</hi> plainly confesses they had Provincial Canons in <hi>France</hi> (such as this of <hi>Mascon</hi>) for these things, and he thought they ought to sway with impartial men, though none of the General Councils had Decreed them, because there was a good reason for that Omission, <hi>viz.</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion of People while those General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils were celebrated. And therefore <hi>Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardus,</hi> take him altogether, confirms this very Council of <hi>Mascon</hi> rather than disproves it, and since Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> must needs know this, it appears he was extremely partial for his espoused Opinion, and studyed to make scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which he knew were insignificant, and he is so conscious of this, that for all his Objections, he grants, <hi>This Council is of some Credit, p.</hi> 57. And <hi>p.</hi> 62. he reckons it among <hi>the known and certain Monuments of Truth.</hi> I am sure <hi>Agobardus</hi> himself, in this very Book cited by <hi>Selden,</hi> agrees with the Council of <hi>Mascon</hi> in this Point, and Asserts
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:200297:141"/> Tithes to be due <hi>Jure Divino.</hi> As for that <hi>[long time of paying Tithes]</hi> which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non speaks of, Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> would have it look no higher than St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine;</hi> and if so, yet even that were fair evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, since St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> lived within Fifty years after the peaceable settling of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity: But nothing is plainer than that this Canon hath respect to the time of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who was Bishop of this very Province; and considering his Opinion and the Custom he mentions, we may conclude, the Council re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to the Practice of their own Province from <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his time, rather than to think they looked abroad to two Foreign Bishops. Having thus answered Mr. <hi>Selden, T. E.</hi> can say little, but only that the <hi>[Divine Laws]</hi> mentioned in this Canon were <hi>Mosaical</hi> Laws: Very strange! Can any man in his Wits think the Fathers of this Council so absurd as to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Law took care of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and Priests of our Christian Churches? or that Christians were sinners, and to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated for not observing Laws pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ceremonial? To conclude therefore, they mean Laws of God now in Force and Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory to Christians; and do most strongly and clearly maintain the <hi>Jus Divinum;</hi> and withal this Canon is not to be looked on as an Evidence of Right and Payment for its own time only; because it relates the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Practice of many years, and long time before it, so that this is as good as a thousand witnesses. And for my part, I
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:200297:142"/> think it so far from being worse for my Cause, that this first plain and undoubted Canon is so late as <hi>An.</hi> 560. or 586. (as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> reckons) that I think it makes more strongly for me, especially since we are sure by this, That for above five hundred years after Christ, Tithes were believed to be due by God's Law, and paid meerly upon that principle; and when there was need of revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Statute to quicken their payment, this Council doth not barely Decree Tithes, but declare and strengthen the Divine Law, and ground their command upon it, and the long obedience paid thereunto. So that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wish for any better witness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 186.] Another plain Evidence we have from the Council of <hi>Hispalis, An.</hi> 590. wherein Tithes are commanded to be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paid, and the payment of them is declared to be according to the Word of God, and agreeable to right Reason, and to detain them is accounted robbing of God himself, which shews they thought them Due <hi>Jure Divino.</hi> All that <hi>T. E.</hi> can say of his own to this is, <hi>That they fetch their Opinion from the words of the Prophet:</hi> To which I reply, They do indeed cite the words of <hi>Malachy,</hi> and in so doing, declare they did not think those words, as they enjoyn a Tenth part, had reference only to the Ceremonial Law, but were Obligatory to Christians. And doubtless all sober men believe that those say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Prophets which contain Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:200297:142"/> Duties, as the Council thinks this of Tithes to be (and those about the Sabbath, <hi>Isa.</hi> lviii. 13. <hi>Ezek.</hi> xx. 20.) are in force still: But <hi>T. E.</hi> hath given fair hints, he would have all the Old Testament set aside, which wicked Opinion was long since condemned in <hi>Marcion,</hi> and other old Hereticks, whose vomit the Quakers commonly lick up, so that we are the less concerned for this poor Cavil. Having therefore little trust in this Answer, he steps back and puts on his Champion Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> to Question the Authority of this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, who Objects <hi>[That it is of much later time, and the first words of it are nothing but the Syllables of one of</hi> Charlemain<hi>'s Laws.]</hi> Now this is a piece of designed Sophistry in Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> on purpose to discredit a witness which he did not like, for he knew full well that these Laws of <hi>Charlemain</hi> are for the most part taken out of preceding Councils, and ancient Constitutions, being a Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of old Decrees rather than a Body of new ones: For the Emperour in his Preface tells the Bishops, <hi>He had made these Laws out of those Canonical Institutions which he thought most necessary for them.</hi> mihi p. 6. And an old Historian assures us that, <hi>Many of these Laws were the confirmation of what was Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally agreed on by his Bishops in several Councils.</hi> Rhegino <hi>Ab.</hi> Prum. <hi>Chronic. An.</hi> 853. Yea <hi>Innocent</hi> cites a Law made by <hi>Theodosius,</hi> and revived by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great. <hi>Decretal.</hi> L. 2. Tit. 1. p. 113. And they that have seen these Capitulars, know that many of them
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:200297:143"/> name those very Ancient Councils out of which they are taken, beginning in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>The Synod of</hi> Nice, <hi>of</hi> Sardis, <hi>&amp;c. saith</hi>— and in the next Law, <hi>Also out of the same Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod</hi>—Moreover divers of these Laws are the Canons of Ancient Councils cited (as part of this of <hi>Hispalis</hi> is) without naming the Council: of which take here a few Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples <hi>[Capit.</hi> L. 1. c. 23. is the sixth Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the fifth Council of <hi>Orleance. ibid. cap.</hi> 133. is the fifth Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice. ibid. cap.</hi> 135. is the fourth Canon of the Council of <hi>Cavaillon:</hi> So also that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution (not of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great (as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> mistakes, but) of his Son <hi>Ludovicus,</hi> L. 2. cap. 36. is the very Canon of the Council of <hi>Arles.]</hi> And yet in none of these places is the Council named: And might not part of a Canon of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Sevil</hi> be transcribed into the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulars, without naming the place whence it was taken, as a hundred other Canons are? 'Tis strange a man of Learning should make so unjust a pretence. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He Objects that <hi>Gratian</hi> did not use these Canons, but <hi>Burchard</hi> and <hi>Ivo</hi> did, which is two for one; <hi>Bernardus non videt omnia; Gratian</hi> surely never saw all Canons, and 'tis likely not these, for if he he had, no doubt he would have cited them with as little scruple, as he doth other Canons of that Age expresly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning Tithes. <hi>Concil.</hi> Cabail. <hi>ap.</hi> Grat. <hi>caus.</hi> 16. <hi>Ecclesiae,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He Objects, That the Canonists put in the word <hi>Tithes,</hi> where
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:200297:143"/> they did not find it: I reply, that the matter of Fact is not certain, but for the present, suppose it were; and if the Canonists do use the word <hi>[Decimae]</hi> to express the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the Primitive Oblations, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain they do not speak too largely, for I have shewed that was the lowest measure; and therefore they give us the sense of these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and withal their own Opinion that these profits of the Field were in the proportion of a Tenth, and whereas Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> accuses a whole Council at once as guilty of this fault. <hi>Concil.</hi> Tribur. <hi>Can.</hi> 13, 14. we take it as a great confirmation of our Opinion, inasmuch as a whole Council near eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ago translate <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> by <hi>[De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimas]</hi> in reciting the fourth General Council, which shews that they (who were far nearer the Primitive times than Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>) did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Fruits then paid were in the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Tenth. But <hi>T. E.</hi> is mistaken in citing Fryar <hi>Crab</hi> to this purpose, for he is not speaking of Canons wrong Translated but falsly Dated. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> brings <hi>Agobardus</hi> upon the Stage again as if he had said, <hi>That no Synod before his time had ordained any thing touching the Quantity to be given for maintaining of Churches.</hi> But so bad a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry had this great Clerk, that herein he gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contradicts himself, for he tells us that <hi>Agobardus</hi> lived about the year 900. And yet Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> himself cites a Council at <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> express for Tithes, <hi>An.</hi> 813. <hi>Hist. Tithes, pag.</hi> 49. And again, <hi>Very frequent</hi> (saith
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:200297:144"/> he) <hi>are the Testimonies of old Councils of about the beginning of these</hi> 400 <hi>years</hi> (that is, from the year 800) <hi>in which Tithes are spoke of as Due generally by God's Ordinance.</hi> Hist. Tithes, p. 122. And doth he not in that Page again cite another Canon for Tithes of Divine Right, <hi>An.</hi> 813. And in his Margin there two more; one <hi>Anno</hi> 646. another <hi>Concil.</hi> Ticin. <hi>Anno</hi> 850. so that Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> baffles himself, and his very Learned and Judicious Bishop too, unless he be expounded of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils as we shewed before, and then these two Canons of <hi>Mascon</hi> and <hi>Sevil</hi> remain firm and Authentick, and Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s Objections vanish. If it were further neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary I could now cite many more Genuine Canons for Tithes at large, made in most of the Provinces of <hi>Europe,</hi> shewing how gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally they agreed from this Age downwards to confirm and re-inforce the Divine Laws for Tithes by fresh Ecclesiastical Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: but since no Schollar will Question this, I shall only cite the names of some of them, and so pass on. <hi>Concil.</hi> Foro—Jul. <hi>Can.</hi> 14. <hi>An.</hi> 791. <hi>Concil.</hi> Turon. <hi>Can.</hi> 46. <hi>An.</hi> 813. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</hi> Aquens. <hi>Can.</hi> 18. <hi>An.</hi> 837. <hi>Concil.</hi> Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens. <hi>Can.</hi> 42. <hi>An.</hi> 843. with some of those mentioned in the 88 Page of my former Book. So that I conclude, Tithes were paid, as of Divine Right, before any Council prescribed them, and that when the decay of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on required the superadding of Ecclesiastical Canons, they declared the Divine Right, and confirmed it, so that we have sufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:200297:144"/> that the Councils, as well as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Fathers, did Hold and Maintain Tithes were Due <hi>Jure Divino.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. PAg. 190. We go on to the Laws of Kings and Emperours touching Tithes, and here this man <hi>of some little Learning,</hi> having no help from <hi>Selden,</hi> makes but one step forward, before he gets a shameful fall, ridiculously mistaking a real Gift of <hi>Constantine</hi>'s, for that fabulous <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> which is exploded by all, as I noted in the Introduction: But as to the Gift I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, besides the Authentick Histories that attest it, I can make it probable it was a kind of Tithes, for the Gift it self is called [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] yearly Measures of Corn, and the Governours of all Cities were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] To give it to the Clergy in a Proportion ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sutable to their Dignity than their need. <hi>Theodoret.</hi> l. 1. cap. 11. So that if we consider this Rule, and the Doctrine of that Age not to give less than a Tenth however, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve withal the Bounty of that pious Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, we can scarce suppose it less than a Tenth of what the Emperour's Officers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and very like it might be more, for <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith that <hi>Constantine gave plentiful provisions out of his own Estate to the Churches of God.</hi> And again, <hi>with many dedicated things he cheerfully filled the Venerable Treasuries.</hi> Vit. <hi>Constant.</hi> l. 1. cap. 35. And elsewhere
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:200297:145"/> he saith that, <hi>He restored to the Church their Houses, Fields, Gardens, and all other things, that had been taken from them by the Persecutors.</hi> L. 2. cap. 39. Now such an Emperour would doubtless in his Gifts come up at least to the proportion of a Tenth, and then this was a Donation of Tithes; and this Law was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed afterwards. <hi>Theod.</hi> lib. 4. cap. 4. and <hi>Sozom.</hi> lib. 6. cap. 3. <hi>T. E.</hi> here asks some ignorant Questions, which shew he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood but little of the state of those times, wherein the Bishops, who were then the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers of Tithes for the whole Clergy, lived usually in the Cities, and we have shewed out of the Fathers that the Country people brought in their Tithes to the Clergy, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this gift of the Emperour, which was out of his own Imperial Revenue, and that shews he was far from thinking the Peoples Tithes too much for his Clergy. As for the other Laws I mentioned, 'tis true I brought not many, but <hi>T. E.</hi> hath not ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered one of them, and (since Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> his Oracle doth not inspire him) he can say nothing at all to the purpose against them, yea he confesses he knows not so much as where to find them [at Second-hand perhaps he means] yet he will be meddling with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters he understands not. As for the First, he saies, <hi>It is no Law, but a Declaration by Doctrine,</hi> p. 192. But surely when Laws de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare a thing ought not to be done, they do forbid the doing of it: And this Law declares that Tithes cannot be alienated from the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:200297:145"/> Church, and consequently forbids Alienati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and that for this Reason, because they are due by God's Law: But <hi>T. E.</hi> (who is a stranger to all former Ages) ventures to guess that this Prohibition speaks it of much later Date than I would have it pass for: wherein he betrays his gross ignorance, for even in <hi>Constantine</hi>'s time <hi>Eusebius</hi> mentions a Law of his, <hi>That the Exchequer it self might not retain any thing belonging to the Church.</hi> Vit. <hi>Const.</hi> l. 2. c. 39. which is to the same sense with this Constitution, and that he may see this principle was much older, I must tell him that it was a Law of the Twelve Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles long before Christ's time, that <hi>He who takes away or steals any thing Holy or Dedicated, let him be a Parricide;</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> adds, <hi>That it is established by the Common-Law of Nations, that no man may seize upon or enjoy that which is consecrated to the Worship of the Immortal Gods.</hi> And if we call to mind what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proved, <hi>viz.</hi> that Tithes were Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated among the Gentiles, it follows that the very Laws of <hi>Rome</hi> before Christianity, forbid the very same thing, which is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by this Constitution of a Christian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and yet a Quaker wonders at it. Now having thus far vindicated this, I shall only cite the Authentick at large, which was barely quoted before, <hi>viz. If a private man possess Tithes, either with or without a Title, no prescription of time can warrant him; for those things which by Law could not be entred upon rightly, can never by Tract of time be made
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:200297:146"/> firmer:</hi> which is the same sort of Prohibition with the preceding Constitution, and both of them prove, the Law-makers then thought Tithes due <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> and till Popery and Atheism ushered in one another, Alienations were unheard of in the Christian World: But as for Civil Laws that concern Tithes I will here remark, <hi>First,</hi> That Tithes being believed to be due by God's Law, were thought in those Ages to be principally of Ecclesiastical Cognizance, and therefore the Laws for them are most frequent in Canons of Councils, and since the Devotion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians first, and then the Ecclesiastical Laws superadded, were enough to move all men to bring in Tithes; the great care of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Law was only to secure the Church in the possession of them, and that is the very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of these two Laws. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let it be noted that the Canons of Councils were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies confirmed of old, by Imperial or Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Authority, and so were of equal force with Civil Laws. Nor is the strict difference between Ecclesiastical and Civil Laws, so much to be insisted on in reference to those Ages. For whereas the first Canon of the fourth General Council, <hi>Establisheth all Canons made by the Holy Fathers in every Synod held be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time,</hi> The Civil Law Decrees, <hi>That the Ecclesiastical Canons made by the four Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils shall have the force of Laws.</hi> Novel. 131. c. 1. So that all the Canons of the old Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils were by <hi>Justinian</hi> made to have the force of Civil Laws. And for the Provincial
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:200297:146"/> Councils they were confirmed by their own Kings. Thus <hi>Guntheran</hi> confirmed the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of <hi>Mascon</hi> for his Kingdom, and <hi>Reccare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> confirmed those of <hi>Sevil,</hi> or <hi>Hispalis</hi> for his; which Story if <hi>T. E.</hi> be a stranger to, 'tis no wonder to me, who am assured under his own Hand that he is a stranger to all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity. But nothing is clearer evidence of this than the Capitulars, which are the very Canons of Councils turned into Civil Law, by adding the Authority of the Western Emperour unto them, and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of these Capitulars (which may be reckoned both Civil and Ecclesiastical Laws too) do strictly enjoyn Payment of Tithes as our very Adversaries confess: wherefore we have sufficiently evidenced, that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Laws of Kings and Emperours did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare Tithes to be of Divine Right, and on that ground forbid the Alienation, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn the Payment of them: And since all those Proofs are left unanswered by <hi>T. E.</hi> I shall take these for good Witnesses till he prove the contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 194, 195. When the Quaker is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of all other Holds, he hath one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge which he alwaies flies to, <hi>viz.</hi> Exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against the persons and times that were favourable to Tithes, as being corrupted with Popery; this Song he Sings over and over, and one half of his Book is taken up with it. The times of <hi>Charlemain</hi> and <hi>Ethelwolph</hi> (he saith) were Popish, and themselves also; so was <hi>Ina, Boniface,</hi> the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and every
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:200297:147"/> one we mention; this dirt lies ready to fling when he wants other matter for reply: But that I may not leave the Question of Tithes at every turn, I shall here give one General Reply to all these impertinent and tedious Excursions of his, <hi>viz. First,</hi> Supposing the Times or Persons who were of our opinion in Point of Tithes, were in some other Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions corrupted with Popery, it doth not follow from thence, That Tithes are Popish, unless those Times and Persons held no other Opinions but Popish Opinions, and <hi>T. E</hi>'s so often repeated Argument might serve an <hi>Arrian</hi> to prove it Popish to hold that Jesus was the Eternal Son of God, for such an one might argue as <hi>T. E.</hi> doth, that Popery crept in betimes; and that those who held this Opinion were corrupted with many Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious Doctrines, and Practices, therefore (in the Quakers Logick) this of Christ's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very God, is a Popish Doctrine: How thin is this Fallacy? Would not any sober man deride this <hi>Arrian</hi> who to prove that Christ's Divinity was a Popish Doctrine, should only muster up a long Roll of Popish Doctrines and Practices held and done in the times, and by the persons who believed this Article of the Faith? Yet this is <hi>T. E</hi>'s way of proving Tithes Popish. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> He must know there are many Opinions and Practices of Papists which are not Popery, <hi>viz.</hi> Praying to God, giving Alms, honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parents, keeping the Lord's Day, and (which is our present subject) paying of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:200297:147"/> Tithes. And we shall here offer these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove Tithes are no Popish Opinion or Practice. <hi>First,</hi> Because they were held, maintained, and paid in the Church long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was corrupted with Popery, and by those very persons which condemn all the Opinions that are properly called Popish. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because no Tithes are paid in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Pope's own Country, and the chief Seat of Popery. Sir <hi>Edw. Sandys</hi> his Survey of the State of Religion, <hi>pag.</hi> 157. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Because they are paid in Protestant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and particularly in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Fourthly,</hi> The Pope and his Creatures have been, in Opinion and Practice, the greatest Enemies to Tithes, maintaining they are at best but of Ecclesiastical Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and denying they are due by God's Law, which opinion was first broached by a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Fryar, <hi>Alex.</hi> ab <hi>Hales,</hi> Par. 3. qu. 51. dist. 3. An. 1250. and is still maintained by most of the Jesuits, who agree with the Quakers in denying Tithes to be due by God's Law; and upon the same Popish Principle, the Pope hath given his consent to so many Exemptions, Alienations, Impropriations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as seem to manifest he was far enough from our Opinion of the Divine Right of Tithes. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Divers Protestants both at home and abroad do defend the Divine Right, and pay them regularly, and the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Divines have Disputed against Papists and Fanaticks both in defence of them: So that supposing <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, <hi>Ethelwolph,</hi> and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:200297:148"/> others had been Popish in other points, yet as to Opinion and Practice of Tithes, they were contrary to the Pope, and most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Papists, and did agree with the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Fathers, with old Councils, and with the present Protestant Church of <hi>England. Thirdly,</hi> He frequently brings in my Friend's Definition of Popery, and since he likes that so well, I will prove by that very Definition that Tithes are not Popery, which my Friend thus defines, <hi>Popery is such Doctrines and Superstitious Practices, which by corruption of time have prevailed in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>contrary to the true ancient Catholick and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Church.</hi> Now as for Tithes, they were never branded by any Orthodox Fathers as Superstitious, but asserted due by God's Law. Nor did they prevail by corruption of time, since they were required and paid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the times were corrupted; and in the grossest times of Popery, Tithes were rather diminished by Alienations, Exemptions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then improved: Nor did this Opinion and Practice prevail in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at all, however not since the gross corruption of it, and when it did prevail, it was more preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in all other Churches than in that Church; and, as we have shewed, was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained over all the Christian World. <hi>Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Tithes are so far from being contrary to the true ancient Catholick and Apostolick Church, that it is now made plain it was all along the Doctrine and Practice of the True, Ancient, Catholick and Apostolick Church.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:200297:148"/> Therefore Tithes are not Popish, and what ever other Opinions those Persons held, which gave or maintained Tithes, they were Orthodox however in this Point. And thence it follows that all his large Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons out of Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> to asperse Times and Persons with Popery, are nothing at all to the Question; and therefore (least we be tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) they shall be lightly passed by, with brief reflexions on his most obvious mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. PAg. 195. 196. I do not wonder the Quaker should call my citing Learned Authors [travelling forreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries] for the Reader may all along perceive they are <hi>Terra Incognita</hi> to him, a world which he never travelled in; but this his want of learning is accompanied with so much Self-conceit, that he charges me with wanting an occasion to brand him for Ignorance, when his whole Book is a perfect demonstration of his little skil in Learned Writers and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. Nor was it an improbable conjecture that a man of <hi>T. E</hi>'s qualifications, might think <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> was the first Tith-giver in this Nation; however my Friend did advise the searching of Antiquaries and Church-Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, implying that there any might find full satisfaction; but the Quaker (whose design was, not to be satisfied, and who aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not at Truth in this dispute, but at ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Party) He resolves to consult no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:200297:149"/> of this kind, but runs upon <hi>Ethelwolfs</hi> Charter only. And now when I come to produce earlier proofs than that; he tells us plainly he will [wave them] and so indeed he doth, for he gives not one solid answer to them. When I produce the words of the great and Learned <hi>Fleta; that</hi> Church-esset <hi>was a certain measure of Corn, which every one gave,</hi> &amp;c. He floutingly derides that Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Master of Law saying, <hi>doubtless every one had not a Crop of Corn growing;</hi> a poor eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion! since it is enough to our purpose that <hi>Fleta</hi> assures us, every one who had Corn growing, paid a certain measure of it to the Church, as well before the <hi>Saxons</hi> time as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for this proves that before the year 600 in the <hi>Britons</hi> time, the Clergy were not maintained by arbitrary Contributions, but a fixed and certain proportion of the Fruits of the Earth, paid in kind; and considering the declared Opinions of the Fathers for a Tenth part long before this, and the several interpretations which I produced out of the best <hi>Glossaries,</hi> of the word <hi>Chirch-set,</hi> or <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric-sceat,</hi> viz. Tribute of the Church, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of Corn, the Church-seed, and First-fruits, (words often applied to Tithes) it is probable enough the <hi>Britons</hi> might pay this in the proportion of a Tenth, and among the <hi>Saxons</hi> this appears to have been esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished under severe penalties by one of King <hi>Ina</hi>'s Laws above 150 years before <hi>Ethelwolf;</hi> so that these proofs ought not to have been so slightly waved, as they are, by my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary:
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:200297:149"/> Who since he cannot deny this certain fixed Maintenance setled by Law in the time of King <hi>Ina;</hi> flies to his old Art of branding <hi>Ina</hi> with Superstition, which, as I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (if it were true) would not invalidate those acts of which were certainly pious, as all the world hath thought the Provisions for Gods Ministers to be. But indeed <hi>T. E.</hi> is mistaken in his charge, for what sober Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant will say, 'tis Superstition to build a Chappel, and garnish it with Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and rich Ornaments? And how <hi>Speed</hi> can make it sense, that Holy Water was an Ornament, or that the Founder of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel gave that, which the Priests use to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate and renew frequently, I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand; and neither <hi>Speed</hi> nor <hi>T. E.</hi> can prove that the <hi>Saxons</hi> used Images (in those daies) any otherwise than for Ornament, and that is no Superstition. As for <hi>Ina</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>He was the great example of Valour, the Mirror of Prudence, and for Religion he had no Peer.</hi> Malsbur. <hi>de gest, Reg.</hi> Angl. <hi>pag.</hi> 7. And for his going to <hi>Rome</hi> after he had piously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed his Crown and renounced all worldly glory; it was because of the great number of Devout Persons which fame then report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to live there; but <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Huntingdon</hi> (who mentions this journey) saith nothing of his leading a Monkish life. <hi>Hist. l.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 194. And <hi>Malmsbury</hi> flatly denies his taking upon him a religious habit saying, <hi>Ibi amictu plebeio tectus, clam consenuit;</hi> which implies he lived privately in the habit of an ordinary
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:200297:150"/> Lay-man. Nor was <hi>Rome</hi> so idolatrous then as <hi>T. E.</hi> pretends, for the Councils then called there about that time, <hi>viz. Ann.</hi> 725. did only condemn those who defaced Images and broke them to pieces, but do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any worship to be given to them, for that was not enjoyned before the second Council of <hi>Nice, Ann.</hi> 788. above 50<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. years after <hi>Ina</hi>'s death. Finally let it be observed that King <hi>Ina</hi> among those Laws for the Church-Maintenance made Laws also for the observation of the Lords day, <hi>c.</hi> 3. and against False-witness, <hi>Cap.</hi> 12. <hi>ap.</hi> Spelm. <hi>Ann.</hi> 692. with many others. And will any sober man think it is a sufficient confutation of those Laws, or a proof they are Popish and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious, to bring in a list of other kind of Superstitions practised in that Age? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these proofs of a fixed Maintenance, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished by Law and paid in kind, do yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in full force.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 198. &amp;c. All the pretence is, that Tithes are not named in those instances, and though they are implied; and very probable the Maintenance was paid in that proportion, and <hi>T. E.</hi> doth not attempt to shew it was in any other proportion, yet because he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the name, I gave him another exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Tithes expresly named as usually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived here, within 20 years after King <hi>Ina</hi> resigned his Crown, and above 100 years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ethelwolfes</hi> Charter; and this in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Epistle of our Countriman <hi>Boniface</hi>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:200297:150"/> Bishop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> to <hi>Cuthbert</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> and if this be not a good proof, then History and the most authentick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords prove nothing. But <hi>T. E.</hi> must seem to say somewhat, wherefore first he saies, <hi>This is far from the earliest daies of Christianity:</hi> I answer 'tis not very far from the earliest daies of the <hi>Saxons</hi> Christianity, and of them we are here speaking, for this Epistle being writ <hi>Ann.</hi> 745. was within little more than 100 years of the <hi>Saxons</hi> first conversion; and since <hi>Boniface</hi> speaks of it as a thing usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ordinarily done then, 'tis likely they had paid Tithes from their first conversion. Nor need the Quaker ask, why there was nothing determined in the Council of <hi>Clove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sho</hi> about them? because that Council was called to reform those things only which <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface</hi> in the Epistle had complained to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss; but this very Epistle confesses Tithes were then paid by the People, and constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received by the Priests, so that there was no need of a Law to reform that which was well done already. Wherefore <hi>T. E.</hi> is driven to his last shift of falsly accusing <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface</hi> of Popery, &amp;c. Which accusations (were they never so true) do not at all hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him from being a good Witness as to matter of Fact, nor do they blemish Tithes which were asserted by the Primitive Fathers many Ages before Popery came in. But Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> in his zeal against Popery doth a little mislead his blind follower <hi>T. E.</hi> in several particulars of this Accusation; for whereas he
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:200297:151"/> charges him to be <hi>for maintaining Superstitious Orders of lascivious Nuns, and other Religions:</hi> 'Tis evident that none was more severe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst lascivious Nuns, and other wanton persons among the Clergy than he, witness three of his Epistles still extant; his Epistle to King <hi>Ethelbald,</hi> ap. <hi>Spelm. Concil. pag.</hi> 232. to <hi>Cuthbert, ibid. pag.</hi> 241. and to Pope <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary, ap.</hi> Bin. <hi>Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>par.</hi> 1 <hi>pag.</hi> 362. And all Antient Historians describe him to have been a very Holy person, who had conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many Thousand <hi>Frisons</hi> from <hi>Paganism;</hi> and after he had enjoyed the Bishoprick of <hi>Mentz</hi> 10 years, he freely resigned it, and went again to preach the Gospel to the rest of the <hi>Frisons,</hi> amongst whom he was at last Martyred, <hi>Ann.</hi> 755. Nor will any man believe this <hi>Boniface</hi> was the Author of that monstrous Doctrine, <hi>that if the Pope live never so wickedly, no man may rebuke him;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his Epistles yet extant do utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute it, for he boldly and smartly reproves the vices of <hi>Rome</hi> itself, in an Epistle to the Pope, <hi>ad</hi> Zachar. <hi>ap.</hi> Bin. <hi>ut supra.</hi> and he lays it down for a maxim, <hi>That the Pope ought not to decree any thing contrary to the Holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, ibid. pag.</hi> 362. And the same Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> complains that <hi>Boniface</hi> had repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him for Simony, <hi>vid.</hi> Bin. <hi>ut supra, pag.</hi> 366. Finally <hi>T. E</hi>s'. Author of <hi>Fasciculus Temporum</hi> calls him a Saint, and the Epitome of <hi>Bede</hi> registers him a Martyr, <hi>Ann.</hi> 754. and this is my witness for Tithes, to whose Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny let me now add that practice of <hi>Eadbert</hi>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:200297:151"/> Bishop of <hi>Limdiffarn,</hi> and Successor to St. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> who was consecrated (saith Sir <hi>Hen. Savil) Ann.</hi> 688. which was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of King <hi>Ina's</hi> Reign, and 50 years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Epistle of <hi>Boniface;</hi> this <hi>Eadbert</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as a Clergy-man) not obliged to pay Tithes to the Church, did every year give the Tithe of his Cattel, Corn and Clothing also to the Poor, <hi>Beda.</hi> Histor. <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 29. Which shews that Tithes were not unusual in <hi>England</hi> long before <hi>Boniface</hi> his time, since one of the Clergy who was not bound to give them to the Chucrh, of voluntary Devotion gave them to the Poor.</p>

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 200. <hi>Egberts</hi> Collection of Canons is my next express Proof for Tithes by name paid before <hi>Ethelwolfe,</hi> viz. <hi>Ann.</hi> 750. Out of these I produced 4 Canons plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring Tithes were then paid and believed due <hi>Jure Divino.</hi> As for the 5 Canon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was long, and part of it was only to direct the Distribution of Tithes after the Clergy had received them (which was nothing to the present Question, <hi>whether they were then paid to the Clergy or no?</hi>) I did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit part of it and cited no more than related to that which I was to prove; and this <hi>T. E.</hi> exclaims against as a piece of Craft, but I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure him, I am glad he hath cited it at large, for now his Quakers may see that Tithes were certainly paid above 100 years before <hi>Ethelwolf;</hi> and that so fully and exactly, that there was enough to repair Churches, and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:200297:152"/> relieve the poor, as well as to maintain the Clergy out of them. And if those Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations, Exemptions and Compositions (which the Pope long after brought in, and our most zealous haters of Popery continue among us) were removed, and Tithes now paid as fully as they were of Old; I doubt not the Clergy would be willing to divide them now, as they did in those Ages. But my Adversary (foreseeing this Answer ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirms than disproves the payment) flies to his dear <hi>Selden,</hi> (whose help he hath long wanted) and out of him attempts to prove that some of these Canons were not made till <hi>Egberts</hi> Death. But we shall find Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> and his retailer both mistaken in this matter. <hi>First,</hi> They object that <hi>some whole Constitutions in this Collection occur in the same Syllables in the Capitulars of</hi> Charles <hi>the Great, particularly, Can.</hi> 25. But I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, that Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> wilfully equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates in this Objection, because he knew ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, that those Capitulars as well as these Constitutions were both collected out of preceding Councils; so that the Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars may very well cite the same words that <hi>Egbert</hi> had collected 50 years before, out of the same Council, and it cannot fairly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred that these Constitutions must needs be later than the Capitulars upon this account, it being more likely that the Emperour cited them out of <hi>Egbert</hi> at second hand. But as to the Canon mentioned in Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> viz. the 25, it is none of those I quoted for Tithes,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:200297:152"/> so that if that Canon be in the Capitulars, yet none of those I cited are. And yet if they had been found there, they had not been less valid; because Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> gives like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the very same Syllables in later Councils taken out of those preceding. Hist. of Tithes <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. §. p. 112. 113. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. §. 10. p. 221. And those who have read the Councils know, that nothing is more u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual. And 'tis no wonder that 25 Canon of <hi>Egbert</hi> is in the same words in the Capitulars, because both of them took it out of the Council of <hi>Hispalis, Ann.</hi> 590. But Mr <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> objects <hi>that before the Capitulars there was no Canonical Authority for dividing the Tithes</hi> (coram Testibus) <hi>before Witnesses;</hi> and therefore <hi>Egbert</hi> could not mention that 50 years before. To this I Answer, that the Council of <hi>Antioch, Ann.</hi> 341. Ordains <hi>that the Bishop shall make the Priests and Deacons acquainted with the goods of the Church.</hi> Can. 4. and that <hi>he shall not distribute them without their knowledg,</hi> Can. 15. <hi>Galasius</hi> also appoints <hi>the distribution to be made publickly before Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses. Ann.</hi> 494. <hi>Decr. Ep.</hi> 9. Bin. <hi>T.</hi> 2. p. 1. p. 480. Hence a Council held, <hi>Ann.</hi> 541. saith, <hi>the Bishop must distribute the Treasures of the Church in the presence of the Priests and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, to the Members of the same Church, and to the Poor thereof, according to the Canonical Constitutions,</hi> Concil. <hi>Arvern. ap.</hi> Bin. <hi>T.</hi> 2. p. 2. p. 32. All which Canonical Authority was long before <hi>Egberts</hi> time, so that he might very well take this passage out of Canons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:200297:153"/> his Collections; and Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> was much overseen, to say there was no Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Authority for this before the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great. Having thus disproved these allegations in Confirmation of <hi>Egberts</hi> Collections, <hi>Malmsbury</hi> will shew us that <hi>Egbert</hi> was well fitted for such a word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>a Magazine</hi> (saith my Author) <hi>of all Liberal Arts, and a great lover and Collector of Books; having set up a most noble Library at</hi> York, <hi>as</hi> Alcuinus <hi>witnesseth in an Epistle to</hi> Charles <hi>the Great;</hi> the words of which Epistle are, <hi>Give me (saith</hi> Alcuinus) <hi>Books of more exquisite Scholastical Learning, such as I have had in my own Country, by the Pious and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout industry of my Master</hi> Egbert <hi>the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop; and if it please your Excellence, I will send some of our Youths, who may take all necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things from thence; to bring into</hi> France <hi>the Flowers of</hi> Britain. <hi>Malmsbur. de gest. Pontif. l.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 153. which I cite at large to shew how rarely <hi>Egbert</hi> was qualified and furnished with Learning and Books for such a Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and since <hi>Egbert</hi> was Master to <hi>Alcuinus,</hi> who was the Tutor to <hi>Charles</hi> the great, and the man by whose advise he sat upon making the Capitulars; and <hi>Alcuinus</hi> advised the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror to send to <hi>Egberts</hi> Library for Books, it cannot be doubted but among other Books <hi>Charles</hi> got a Copy of <hi>Egberts</hi> Collections; and arcordingly not only imitated that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in his Capitulars, but also transcribed some whole Canons thence <hi>Verbatim;</hi> and thence it follows, that the places in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulars
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:200297:153"/> which are the same with these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, were taken out of <hi>Egbert</hi> by <hi>Charles</hi> the great, and not his Canons out of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulars, by a later hand, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> did falsly suggest. So that these Canons also are good Evidence for Tithes in <hi>England</hi> above 100 years before <hi>Ethelwolf.</hi>

Nor dares he positively question the Councils being genuine, because Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> (who makes the objections for him) supposes <hi>Kenulphs</hi> name came by the ignorance of the Transcriber, and saith, <hi>that it cannot be suspected by any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance in the Subscriptions, which being so many, might have by chance soon got among them a character of fashood, had it not been genuine. Hist. Tithes, Chap.</hi> 8. §. 2. So that it seems Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> tried to pick some hole in it, but was not able. And though he tells us also <hi>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.</hi> §. 8. <hi>That the Syllables of this Council are in the Constitutions of</hi> Ode. <hi>Ann.</hi> 943. That is nothing but what is very usual, <hi>viz.</hi> for la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Constitutions to repeat the very words of elder Councils, when a fresh occasion makes it necessary to revive a precedent Canon. Wherefore <hi>T. E.</hi> will not insist on these doubtful pleas; but falls to his old Trade of Aspersing the Church that then was, with Popery; which is as little to the purpose as any of his former replies, because Tithes
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:200297:154"/> which are the matter of this Canon, were enjoyned and paid in the very Primitive Church. Suppose the Times were Popish in some things when this Council was held, yet that doth not invalidate all the Canons of it concerning things not Popish; for Example, <hi>Can.</hi> 1. <hi>That the</hi> Nicene <hi>Creed be held, Can.</hi> 13. <hi>That Justice be duly administred, Can.</hi> 15. <hi>That incestuous Marriages be prohibited, Can.</hi> 19. <hi>That the relicks of Paganism be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>T. E</hi>'s. Arguments serve as well to prove these Canons Popish and inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, as those about Tithes; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his long harangues against those times in general are wholly impertinent, and do not weaken my proof at all. Yet I will make some remarks on his mistakes even in this his confident accusation. And <hi>First,</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Pope <hi>Adrians</hi> Legates doth not prove the English Church was then subject to <hi>Rome;</hi> for though the <hi>Roman</hi> Church was ready to assist <hi>England</hi> with Learned men, to counsel them in making Ecclesiastical Laws, yet <hi>Malmsbury</hi> tells us, these came not till <hi>Off a</hi> sent for them, upon occasion of a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel between him and the then Bishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury.</hi> And these two that came do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that none such had ever come before from <hi>Rome</hi> into this Land since <hi>Austins</hi> time, <hi>viz.</hi> for near 200 years. Nor did these men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point any thing by Authority, but only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish our Bishops what they thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be done. <hi>Epist. in proaem.</hi> Spelm. p. 292. and the Bishops also told them of some
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:200297:154"/> other faults which they intended to amend. And after this consultation, the King ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points the day of the Council, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were proposed to the King and Bishops and were agreed upon by Common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and ratified by the King and Bishops Subscriptions, and not by the Legates, who never subscribed at all, but were only advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of and witnesses to those Canons. Nor indeed were these Two properly called Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, for <hi>Eadmerus</hi> (whom Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> hath printed) assures us, that <hi>Guido</hi> Bishop of <hi>Vienna</hi> was the first foreign Legate that ever came hither from <hi>Rome,</hi> and that was not till <hi>Anselms</hi> time. And the Historian saith, <hi>it struck all that heard into admiration, because it was never known in</hi> Britain <hi>before, that any but the Arch-Bishop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>should have the power to rule over them as Legates here, so that he went back as he came, not being received as a Legate by any, nor exercising that Office at all.</hi> Eadm. <hi>edit.</hi> Seld. <hi>pag.</hi> 58. And afterward when <hi>John de Crema</hi> as Legate presumed to sit above the Arch-Bishop in a Council, the English stomached it very much. <hi>Gervas. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rob. Ann.</hi> 1125. Indeed it was long before these Legates Subscribed our Canons, and when they did, their names were put in after our English Bishops, see Sir <hi>Roger Twysdens</hi> Hist. Vind. of the Reform. <hi>pag.</hi> 20. 'Tis true these two who were at this Council of <hi>Calcuth</hi> do stile <hi>Adrian, your Apostleship;</hi> but that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues no universal Headship, for <hi>Selden</hi> upon the aforesaid <hi>Eadmerus</hi> observes, that this
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:200297:155"/> Title was given of old promiscuously to all Bishops, and there are very many instances of it in <hi>Spelman</hi>'s Glossary, <hi>Verb.</hi> Apostolici <hi>p.</hi> 35. and <hi>Causab.</hi> exercitat. in <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 32. num. 5. p. 228, 229. where it may be seen how private Bishops received that Title very frequently. And for Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> I shall only note that Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> hath taken his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter out of our fierce Country-man Mr. <hi>Bale,</hi> de Vit. <hi>Rom. Pontif.</hi> p. 93. a Book very full of gross mistakes, and neither doth <hi>Platina</hi> mention any such Book Writ by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> for Images; nor <hi>Binius</hi> mention any such Council of his to establish the Worship of them: But if it were true that <hi>Adrian</hi> were for Image-worship, that alone would prove the <hi>English</hi> Church was not subject to him, because it is certain that <hi>Offa</hi> and his Clergy Opposed, Condemned, and Writ against that Doctrine, <hi>Spelm.</hi> Tom. 1. pag. 317, 318. Nor was there any Canon made here for the Adoration of them for some hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years after: see also Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s Defence of the Discourse of Idolatry, <hi>pag.</hi> 812, <hi>&amp;c. T. E.</hi> therefore is mistaken, and my Proof stands good.</p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. PAg. 206. To these Testimonies I affirmed, might be added all those Charters of our Princes (of whom I am speaking) which from the beginning of Christianity (among the <hi>Saxons</hi>) did (in the general) confirm all the Liberties and Revenues of the Church, and that <hi>T. E.</hi> may see, it is his ignorance only that perswades
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:200297:155"/> him this is a flourish or a falshood, I shall cite some of them. <hi>First,</hi> There is a Charter of <hi>Ethelbert</hi> their first Christian King, <hi>To secure the Possession of the Church, and the Bishops, and other Orders of the Clergy.</hi> Spelm. <hi>Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>An.</hi> 610. <hi>p.</hi> 127. which is also fully attested by Venerable <hi>Bede. Hist. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 62. As also the Laws of King <hi>Ina</hi> mentioned before, <hi>An.</hi> 692. And the Laws and Charters of King <hi>Withred,</hi> the first in a Council at <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canfield, An.</hi> 694. against the Sacrilegious detaining the Churches Rights; another in a Council at <hi>Berghamsted,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Church shall be free and enjoy its Rights and Revenues, An.</hi> 697. to which may be added another Priviledge of that King, <hi>An.</hi> 700. <hi>Spelm.</hi> Tom. 1. p. 198. Now since by several proofs I have already made out, that Tithes were in that Age among the Rights and Revenues of the Church, it follows that all these are Laws to confirm Tithes, yet for brevity sake I omitted them before, contenting my self to begin with King <hi>Ethelbald</hi>'s Charter, <hi>An.</hi> 749. (and not 794. as it was falsly Printed before) which Charter confirms to the Clergy, <hi>Propriam libertatem, their proper or peculiar Liberty in the Fruits of the Woods and Fields,</hi> &amp;c. Now what Liberty could there be in these, peculiar and proper to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, but only Tithes, which that Age believed no Lay-man might enjoy? And for that weak Objection, that <hi>it speaks generally,</hi> not the Priests or Clergy only, but <hi>[the Servants of God]</hi> This is but a further confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:200297:156"/> how little the Quaker knows the phrase of those times wherein the Clergy only were stiled <hi>[famulos Dei]</hi> Vid. Concil. <hi>Cloves.</hi> Can. 29. An. 747. and <hi>Spelm. Glossarium</hi> Verb. Parliamentum, <hi>p.</hi> 450. and <hi>Hist. of Tithes</hi> by Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> p. 215. Wherefore <hi>Ingulphus</hi> expresly saith that <hi>Ethelbald</hi> made this Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to promote the Holy Church throughout his whole Kingdom, and for confirming the Ecclesiastical Liberties through his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Ingulph.</hi> edit. <hi>Savil.</hi> p. 486. And now he hath no shelter left but to accuse <hi>Ethelbald</hi> of Popery, the folly of which evasion is shewed before. And as to those phrases in the grant which <hi>T. E.</hi> so severely out of Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> remarks upon, I shall only observe, That <hi>Ethelbald</hi> had been a great Sinner, and being by some of the Clergy brought to repentance, he did these good Offices for the Instruments of his Conversion, in token of his sincere Reformation. And therefore in the Phrase of elder times, he is said to have done these things, <hi>For the Love of his heavenly Country and the Redemption of his Soul, and that his Soul might hereby be freed from the Bond of Sin:</hi> by which was intended no more, than that good works being the only true signs of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Repentance, and a lively Faith, and these two the certain procurers of Pardon, Grace and Glory, he did by good works seek an interest in Jesus Christ his Merits, and gave good evidence of such Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as would intitle him to Pardon and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. And 'tis not probable <hi>Ethelbald</hi>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:200297:156"/> thought his Merits alone could deserve a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdom, since he confesses within two lines, that <hi>God had given him his temporal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom meerly of his Mercy and Clemency without any Merits of his own,</hi> Ingulphus <hi>ut supr.</hi> But if this phrase prove <hi>Ethelbald</hi> a Papist, <hi>T. E.</hi> will find some Papists among his chief friends the Quakers, for divers of them deny Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Faith, and the imputed Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ; <hi>Pen</hi>'s Counterfeit Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, <hi>p.</hi> 106. <hi>Whitehead</hi>'s Nature of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, <hi>pag.</hi> 32, 33. And when it is object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> there, that this was a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Opinion, He replys, <hi>Wherein the Papists hold any Truth, though in unrighteousness, I must not therefore deny it:</hi> so the Quaker. And if that be a good answer, then <hi>T. E.</hi> vainly takes pains to prove Tithe-givers, Papists, for if Papists hold a Truth (as I have proved the right of Tithes under the Gospel to be) that Quaker will not have us to deny it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Papists hold it. I only add, that it is most base and disingenuous in <hi>T. E.</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach <hi>Ethelbald</hi> as a lewd and vicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to discredit his Donation, because he was become a Convert before he made this Charter, so that in the very Title it is said he did it, when he had repented of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer evil Life. The Jews were wont to say, <hi>Ʋpbraid not a Proselyte with his Fathers Deeds,</hi> nor a Convert (say I) with his own former Actions. This is as foolish and impious as to have gone about to lessen St. <hi>Paul</hi> after his Conversion, with the Story of his Persecuting
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:200297:157"/> and Blasphemy; but what will not <hi>T.E.</hi> do, to uphold a sinking Cause?</p>

The last of my Instances before <hi>Ethelwolfe,</hi> was that express Gift of Tithes by King <hi>Offa,</hi> An. 793. which my Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry can neither deny nor disprove. But poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seeks to discredit both the Gift and the Giver, and by Mr. <hi>Fox</hi>'s help out of <hi>Jorval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lensis</hi> (as he ought to call him) he tells us, the occasion of this Gift was a horrid Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: An Objection which 'tis hard to say whether it savours more of folly or malice, for it was his Repentance and not his Sin that occasioned the Gift, as his own Historian e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies, <hi>His Pride was brought down to so great Humility and Repentance</hi> (saith he) <hi>that he gave the Tithe of all that he had to the Holy Church,</hi> Brampton <hi>Histor.</hi> Jorval. so that the giving Tithes was then esteemed an act plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to God, a good Fruit of Repenatnce, a sign of an humbled Soul, that was become sensible of its Duty to God. And his Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was no more the cause of his giving Tithes, than <hi>Zacheus</hi> his Injustice was of his Restitution, or St. <hi>Paul</hi> getting Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to Persecute, of his Conversion and Zeal afterwards. And whereas <hi>T. E.</hi> thinks I cannot prove that <hi>Offa,</hi> and his Clergy, condemned Worshipping of Images, 'tis no great matter what he thinks, but I shall prove it presently to the satisfaction of competent Judges, and here only refer the Reader to an Authentick witness of it, <hi>Rog. Hoved.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:200297:157"/> par. 1. An. 792. Well but <hi>Offa</hi> must needs be a Papist because he went to <hi>Rome:</hi> and I pray are all Papists that go to <hi>Rome?</hi> I am informed that some Quakers went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not long since, and by the Pope's Special Order had Lodgings provided in the Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal for Mad-men; were these also Papists? And if King <hi>Offa</hi> held communion with <hi>Rome,</hi> so do we with the Protestant Churches of <hi>Germany, Holland, France,</hi> &amp;c. but yet we do not therefore hold all their Opinions, nor are we at all subject to them: So that King <hi>Offa</hi> cannot properly be called a Papist: and if he could, that doth not confute my Proposition, <hi>viz. That Tithes</hi> (which had been given and received long before Popery) <hi>were given and paid in this Nation long before King</hi> Ethelwolfe; and this is the full Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Opinion and Practice concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tithes before this famous Charter: by which it appears that <hi>Ethelwolfe</hi> in this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Settlement of them, did act agreeable to the sense of the best Fathers, and purest Times, and had the concurrent suffrages of Fathers and Councils, of Kings and Bishops Foreign and Domestick, from the Daies of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> An. 170. down to his own time to justifie this voluntary Donation, it having been the practice of the Church then for 700 years: And what could be done with greater evidence or fuller Authority?</p>
               <p n="11">
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:200297:158"/>§. 11. PAg. 211. I suppose the Reader will not account this clear deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the History of Tithes a far-fetcht compass, as <hi>T. E.</hi> doth, but a regular and direct proceeding to the Charter of King <hi>Ethelwolfe,</hi> who being the first Hereditary Monarch of all <hi>England,</hi> made the first gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Grant for the whole Nation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by confirmed the Right of Tithes, which by custom, and the bounty of faithful Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, had obtained and were paid in several Provinces long before his time: And from hence I dated my Third Particular, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Voluntary Donation</hi> of Tithes, which I proved by shewing that this Donation was made by the supreme Monarch in a General Council of all <hi>England,</hi> with the full and free consent of his Tributary Kings, his Bishops and other Clergy, his Nobles, and an infinite multitude of his People, so that the whole Nation joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Voluntary Donation, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral practice for many Ages hath declared the validity of this Gift, not only by observing it, but by the making frequent Laws almost in every King's Reign since to ratifie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it, which brings in those positive Laws for Tithes, my Fourth Particular, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully strengthens the Voluntary Donation of them: Now this Universal consent at the making of this Charter, and the constant and renewed ratifications of it in every suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Age, I briefly shewed in five Pages
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:200297:158"/> together, <hi>pag.</hi> 95, 96, 97, 98, and 99. And my voluminous Answerer (who brags in his Title Page, he hath removed both this Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Donation, and the positive Laws for Tithes) slips all these Pages with two or three poor Cavils, giving no reply to all this full Evidence, but saith to avoid repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he will not answer my inference from these proofs; but let it be observed, that if he had any thing to say, he is not so averse from repetition, as to forbear it on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, for he can nauseously repeat one long Quotation three or four times over when he sees fit: So that I take it for granted he had nothing hereto reply, but these trifling Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. <hi>First,</hi> He asks <hi>Whether this Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were a Grant or a Confirmation?</hi> I answer, it was both in several respects; a Grant with respect to the whole Kingdom, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of one supreme Monarch; and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation with respect to the Custom of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Provinces and the devout liberality of particular persons before. <hi>Secondly,</hi> When he should disprove the many confirmations of this Charter, and the renewed Laws for Tithes in every succeeding Age, he slips away and saies, <hi>The Question is not how late Tithes were settled, but how early?</hi> Whereas I had answered that Question of early settling of Tithes before, when I shewed the Primitive Practice; and the Question here was, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were Freely given in this Nation, and that Gift sufficiently confirmed by posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Laws in every Age since? And let the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:200297:159"/> Reader judge if I have not made out this. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He quarrels with a single passage of mine, <hi>viz.</hi> where I say that, <hi>The benefit of this Donation hath been enjoyed for eight hundred years by them to whom the Donation was made.</hi> And hence he hopes to brand the present Clergy of the Church of <hi>England</hi> with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery. But alas, this will not stick, for the Donation was made to God and the Church, to the Clergy in General, without respect to a future distinction between Popish and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant, and he falsly supposes the Clergy then to be Popish; yet if they were so, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was made to them as God's Ministers, and as such only I considered them. Now the benefit of this Donation hath been enjoyed by those whom the Supreme Authority al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for such, for these eight hundred years, and though a Protestant and a Popish Priest differ in Opinion very much, yet the Office of Priest-hood is the same in both, and all Protestant Churches own this, in that they never re-ordained a Converted Popish Priest, because his Ordination is valid, though his Opinions were heretical or false. By the Priests then, that have been publickly allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for God's Ministers, hath the benefit of this Donation been enjoyed for above eight hundred years, and as they are free Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> they cannot be deprived of this Right without their own consent.</p>

                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:200297:159"/>§. 12. PAg. 214. The silence of my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to all this Evidence of matter of Fact is a plain confession that there was a <hi>Voluntary Donation</hi> of Tithes, and continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repeated positive Laws to secure them; which being not to be denied, the Quaker seeks other Evasions: And first for the Charter of <hi>Ethelwolfe,</hi> he Objects against the Author of it, the ends for which it was made, and the motives to it. <hi>First,</hi> He had said in his first Book, <hi>That King</hi> Ethelwolfe <hi>the Author was a Papist;</hi> and had cited a whole Page out of a late <hi>English</hi> Chronicler to prove it: To this Page I thought it enough to say in my former Book, That his holding some Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, doth not prove him a Papist who doth not profess himself a member of that Church, nor own the Pope's Supremacy. And I did more slightly pass this enquiry, because it is nothing to my main Question; for <hi>Ethelwolfe</hi>'s being a Papist (if he were granted to be such) would not inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate his Donation of Tithes, unless <hi>T. E.</hi> can prove that a Papist cannot make a good deed of Gift, even of those things which Scripture, expounded by the Primitive Fathers, and very sound Protestants, saies he ought to give; and since Tithes are of that nature, the Donation of them by <hi>Ethelwolfe</hi> (were he as much a Papist as <hi>T. E.</hi> would make him) must be valid and good: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all this tedious charge of Popery is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:200297:160"/> to the Question, yet because he urges me to reply to it, I will briefly shew that the Quaker doth in many things falsly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse him: For though it be not unlikely that <hi>Egbert</hi> might breed <hi>Ethelwolfe</hi> among the Monks of <hi>Winchester,</hi> in an Age where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Monasteries were the only places where Arts and Sciences could be learned, yet it is no waies probable, that the King's eldest Son should take upon him the Vow and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of a Monk. <hi>Asserius</hi> who knew <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wolfe</hi> very well, and in the life of <hi>Alfred,</hi> gives us an account of him, saies nothing of any such Vow, no, nor <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> neither, though he highly extol his Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yea, this Historian saith, he was made one of the Generals of his Fathers Forces in the Eighth year of his Reign, <hi>Anno</hi> 807. and that he continued in that Capacity to subdue his Fathers Enemies till the 24. <hi>An.</hi> 823. <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Huntingdon</hi> also mentions him as General in that twenty fourth year of his Fathers Reign, <hi>pag.</hi> 197. and <hi>Roger Hoveden</hi> speaks of his being General in the fourteenth year. <hi>Aethelwerd,</hi> another old Writer, sets down the same in the year 823. and hath not a Syllable of his being bred a Clergy-man: Now considering his Father was exercised with continual Wars in the latter part of his Reign, it is not likely he should leave that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for a Cloyster. And indeed all that I can find in any old Author of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among the Clergy is, that <hi>Malmesbury</hi> saith, he was made a Sub-deacon by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:200297:160"/> of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> (who was chosen Pope, <hi>An.</hi> 796.) but then doubtless he was very young; and besides, <hi>Malmesbury</hi> mentions neither Vow nor Absolution, and good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, because there was no Vow of single life required then of Sub-deacon, nor of many years after. The Canons of <hi>Aelfricus</hi> made, <hi>An.</hi> 1052. do not enjoyn <hi>Caelibate</hi> to any lower than Deacons, <hi>Vid. Can.</hi> 5. and <hi>Can.</hi> 16. <hi>ap.</hi> Spelm. <hi>Tom.</hi> 1. and the first Foreign Council that imposes it on Sub-deacons (as far as I have found) is that of <hi>Malfi,</hi> An. 1090. Can. 2. ap. <hi>Bin.</hi> T. 3. p. 2. pag. 413. and the first <hi>English</hi> Council is that of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> An. 1102. Can. 7. <hi>Spelm.</hi> T. 2. pag. 22, 24. Nor indeed was a Sub-deacon of old accounted any Order of Clergy: And (which is most considerable) if <hi>T. E.</hi> could prove <hi>Ethelwolfe</hi> was a Monk of <hi>Winchester</hi> (which he cannot do) that will not evidence that he was under a Vow of single Life, for <hi>Spelman</hi> makes it out (past all exception) that the Monks of <hi>Winchester</hi> were not bound by any such Vow before King <hi>Edgar</hi>'s time, who first brought in Regular Monks there from <hi>Abingdon,</hi> An. 967. that is above one hundred years after our <hi>Ethelwolfe</hi> was dead; nay <hi>Spelman</hi> further proves out of a Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script Chronicle, and other good Authority, that no Monks in <hi>England</hi> took this Vow to live single, but only those of <hi>Glastenbury</hi> and <hi>Abingdon</hi> till the year 966. So that the whole story of his Vow of single Life, and of the pretended Popes Absolution grounded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:200297:161"/> is a meer Legend of later lying Monks, too credulously received by some hasty mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Writers. And so also is that other Tale of his being Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> since the best Authors do make <hi>Swithin</hi> the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Successor to <hi>Helmstan,</hi> and leave no room for the pretended Consecration of <hi>Ethelwolfe,</hi> Malmesbur. <hi>de gest.

Again, the <hi>Peter</hi>-pence were for many years a free Alms: and our Learned Writers do evidently make out they were no mark of the subjection of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, <hi>Spelm.</hi> Concil.

And for <hi>Ethelwolfe</hi>'s private boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Pope, it was not till after he had been at <hi>Rome,</hi> and found that Church misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly poor, and sadly oppressed by the Invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and in pure Compassion he sent three hundred Marks thither next year, and on his Death-bed desired that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief might be continued. Nor was it long after when Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> complains to the Emperour <hi>Basilius,</hi> that he had not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to buy Oyl for the Lamps of the Church, <hi>Epist.</hi> Steph. <hi>ad</hi> Basil. <hi>ap.</hi> Bin. <hi>T.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 108. Now this use of Lamps in the Church at Prayers was used ever since the Primitive Christians met in the night to serve God; and considering how dark all Churches in <hi>Italy</hi> are, they are not only a memorial of those times of Persecution, but are really ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be used there. So that if <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wolfe</hi>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:200297:161"/> pitied the oppression and poverty of so famous a Church, and sent some Alms thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to maintain the Clergy, or the service of God there; this no more argues his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to them, than our relieving the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants of <hi>Piedmont</hi> or the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches now proves we are subject to them. Indeed <hi>Ethelwolfe</hi> was a pious and bountiful Prince, and sent Gifts to the Monastery of St. <hi>Denys</hi> (as the Antiquary of that place records) and elsewhere, as well as to <hi>Rome:</hi> only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Rome</hi> was then the most famous place for Learning and Piety in the Western World, he went thither, and having been an eye-witness of their necessities, he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry charitable to that place. Finally his hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some Popish Opinions, will not prove him a Papist, since he owned no subjection to that Church, nor did acknowledge the Pope's Supremacy here, as I shewed before in my one hundredth Page, where I cited two late Learned Authors, worth <hi>T.

My Adversary in his Zeal to overthrow Tithes, doth not scruple to take the Jesuits part, and assert that as long ago as <hi>Ethelwolfe</hi>'s time the Pope had a Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy over <hi>England,</hi> but he makes it out by such false and foolish <hi>Mediums,</hi> that he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shews his good will to that Cause, than
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:200297:162"/> his ability to do it Service: For whereas he saith, Perkins <hi>acknowledges the Pope's Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy began manifestly in</hi> Boniface, <hi>An.</hi> 607. <hi>who obtained of</hi> Phocas, <hi>that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>should be the head of all Churches; Perkins</hi> well knew this was nothing to <hi>England</hi> which was not under <hi>Phocas</hi> Dominion, nor could he give the Pope power over a Church, which was then no part of his Empire: and (to <hi>T.

We may here see an experiment of Quakers Truth. Again, his dabling only in modern Authors betrays him into a gross mistake, in saying, <hi>That from</hi> Austin<hi>'s coming hither for near one hundred years, seven following Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops of</hi> Canterbury <hi>successively were</hi> Italians <hi>and Foreigners:</hi> When as 'tis evident that <hi>Deus dedit</hi> the sixth in Order, and Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor to <hi>Theodorus,</hi> was a <hi>Saxon</hi> born, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Fritho</hi> before his Consecration, <hi>Godw.</hi> de praesul. pag. 59. and <hi>Bede</hi> particularly saith he was one of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> Hist. lib. 3. cap. 20.

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:200297:162"/> to <hi>Rome,</hi> but it was meerly because in a newly Converted Nation there could be none found fit for so high an Office, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> had forbid to choose a new Convert, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. and so had the ancient Canons, <hi>Can.

They did not contend about Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as <hi>T. E.</hi> thinks) since <hi>Wilfred</hi> was Consecrated by the Bishops of <hi>France,</hi> as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> himself had been: But <hi>Theodorus</hi> would needs set up three new Bishopricks in <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frid</hi>'s Province, on pretence it was too large: <hi>Wilfrid</hi> first complains of this injury at the King's Tribunal; and finding no redress, he applied himself to the Pope to get him to admonish <hi>Theodorus</hi> not to proceed. When the King heard of <hi>Wilfrid</hi>'s going to <hi>Rome,</hi> both he and his Courtiers openly derided him; and at his return with the Pope's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, King <hi>Egfrid</hi> was so far (saith my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) from paying any reverence to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> See, That he Imprisoned <hi>Wilfrid,</hi> seized
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:200297:163"/> on all he had, and at length banished him. And at his second return from <hi>Rome,</hi> the same King despised the Popes request, thinking it against all reason to admit a man who had been twice condemned in a Council of all <hi>England,</hi> for any Bishops or Popes Letters, <hi>Malmsbur. gest. Pontif. l.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 149. Nor did <hi>Theodorus</hi> regard the Popes Letters, but continued to prosecute <hi>Wilfrid,</hi> who lived in Exile, till <hi>Theodorus</hi> on his Death-bed moved (not by the Pope to whom he owed no subjection, but) by his own Conscience, procured his restauration. And <hi>Malmsbury</hi> notes that Pope <hi>Agatho</hi> who writ in <hi>Wilfrids</hi> behalf, calls this <hi>Theodorus His fellow Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and Fellow-Bishop, and put off his going to a Council till</hi> Theodorus <hi>should come.</hi> ibid. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 112. The Arch-bishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> therefore was then one of the Popes equals, and though he adviseth him as a Brother, he never commanded him as a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in that Age. And finally it was the Kings Authority and not the Pope that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored <hi>Wilfrid;</hi> so that this very History shews, the Kings of <hi>England</hi> were Supreme here, and <hi>Vicarios Christi,</hi> not the Popes of <hi>Rome;</hi> and the attempts of <hi>T.

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 219. &amp;c. That long Catalogue of Popish Opinions reckoned up by the Quaker and laid to <hi>Ethelwolfs</hi> charge, is evidently false, for I have proved already in part and shall do more fully shortly, that the greater part of them were not so much as held at <hi>Rome</hi> it self in that Age. So that I do justly and on good grounds deny <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> to have been a Papist, and doubt not but it may be made out that <hi>T.E.</hi> and his Brethren hold as many Popish opinions as <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> did. But the main thing is still behind, and that is (supposing he had been a Papist) to prove that his being so, makes his Donation of Tithes void, since Tithes were and are belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved due by those that are Papists; nor can this Donation spring from Popish Opinions properly so called, because then all Papists must give Tithes, and none but Papists, both which are notoriously false. But <hi>T. E.</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs the particular Opinion which was the cause of this Donation, <hi>viz. The belief that this Gift would be a means to appease the Anger of God, obtain remission of Sins, and salvation of his Soul.</hi> I answer, that the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians and modern Protestants, did not and do not hold this Opinion in the Popish sense, and yet both gave Tithes, therefore this was no necessary cause of the Donation; nor indeed (as I have shewed) did <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wolf</hi> hold it in the sense of modern Papists, and as I have already explained it, 'twas no erroneous Opinion, that works of Piety are
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:200297:164"/> fruits of that true Repentance which doth appease Gods Anger, and obtain remission and Salvation. Besides if this Opinion were one cause, there were many other more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable causes than this, <hi>The Justice and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of the Gift it self, the Authority and Examples which had been in the Ages before him, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of the Churches Prayers, his Love to God and his Service, the respect he bore to his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and the equity of freeing them from world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care, that they might more quietly and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably attend on Divine Ministries.</hi> These were other causes, and most of them men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Donation it self, but malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously overlooked by the Quaker, whose mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applied Maxime, <hi>Sublatâ causâ tollitur effectus,</hi> hath nothing to do in these moving causes which only in part incline rational Agents to Act. For if I have twenty Motives to one Act, 'tis possible one or two of them may be taken away, and yet the effect will follow. There were causes enow besides that Opinion, why <hi>Etholwolf</hi> should make this Donation; and no doubt he had made it upon the force of the other Motives, if this had been taken away before he acted; and therefore if <hi>T.E.</hi> could prove this Motive were taken away now, yet the Act remains good as long as any of the Motives do so; and after an Act be once done legally, freely and firmly, it stands good though all the Motives should cease.</p>

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 222.] His distinction between the Acts of Papists in their Civil and Religious Capacity, between what they did as Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and what as Men, is also very frivolous. I will not urge him with that gross contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of saying here, <hi>The Saxon Papists acts as Christians,</hi> and yet <hi>pag,</hi> 302. he says, <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity was extinguished among the</hi> Saxons <hi>soon after</hi> Austins <hi>coming;</hi> and <hi>pag.</hi> 215. <hi>That</hi> Ethelwolfs <hi>Opinions were not consistent with Christianity.</hi> Nor shall I improve that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion which the Quaker here grants, <hi>viz.</hi> That men who give Tithes Act as Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. But I shall tell him, he begs the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and supposes the <hi>Saxons</hi> of that Age were Papists, which he cannot prove, and I have shewed the contrary. But suppose they had been Papists, was not this Law made in a <hi>Micle-gemot,</hi> or as other Civil Laws were? Did not the King confirm it as a King, and the Nobles consent as Nobles, and so for the rest of the Assembly? If the King only made it as a Christian, then one of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might have made it as well as he, for they were as much, and perhaps some of them as good Christians as he. Besides even those Laws which they made concerning Religion were made by them in their Civil Capacity, for they subscribe to them by their Civil Titles; and if it would vacate their Laws and Donations meerly because made by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, (as <hi>T. E.</hi> fancies) in their Religious Capacity, then all Laws and Donations made by Papists concerning Religion would
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:200297:165"/> be void; and if so, our Protestant Princes and Parliaments have been needlesly busy in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking several of the Popish Laws; the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker will tell them they were void of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and needed no repeal. But he must excuse us if we judge our Parliaments wiser than he; and they thought even Laws made by Papists to establish the worst of Popery were valid without a Repeal. But as to this Law for Tithes it was no Law for any thing Popish, and concerned Religion in general, not Popery in particular; since they are as sutable Maintenance for Protestant Ministers as any other; this Law therefore (being confirmed since the Reformation and never repealed) must be valid still. And if all Papist Laws concerning Religion (even where Popish Religion is not particularly concerned) were void, then all the Laws of our Ancestors, for keeping the Lords day, for preaching the Gospel, for punishing Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, Incest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would all be void also; yea and <hi>Magna Charta</hi> too, which is a Law concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion in many parts of it, and was made upon this motive also (among others) <hi>for the Salvation of King</hi> Henries <hi>Soul, and the Souls of his Predecessors;</hi> yet <hi>T. E.</hi> dare not say this is void, no nor their Donations of Schools, Hospitals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though given per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in their Religious Capacity, upon the same motives which he saith inclined <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wolf</hi> to give Tithes, and with intent (at last) to merit Salvation by them; yet even these do all stand good, to this day, and therefore
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:200297:165"/> so ought Tithes also though they had been given with all the ill circumstances that <hi>T. E.</hi> rakes up against them.</p>
               <p n="13">§. 13. PAg. 223. The next objection is concerning the persons to whom Tithes were given, which the Quaker affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was a Popish Clergy, but I shewed they were given to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which had then a Patriarch of its own, and was a Church of it self in those daies, neither hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Opinions of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor yet profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing any obedience to the Pope till near 300 years after, and therefore the English Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy then, were no Popish Clergy. In answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, <hi>T. E.</hi> only discovers his ignorance and dishonesty; for he asks, <hi>First,</hi> if Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Clergy were not English and Popish too? I reply they professed obedience to the Pope, and owned his Supremacy, and held all the Opinions of <hi>Rome,</hi> and so were a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Clergy; but doth it follow from thence that <hi>Ethelwolfs</hi> Clergy who agreed with them in none of these particulars, were Popish also? <hi>Secondly,</hi> He idlely enquires, who was the English Patriarch of old? Surely he ought to know that our Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> of old had the Title and Jurisdiction too of Patriarch; <hi>they were accounted and named Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs,</hi> saith <hi>Gervas.

If the Quaker had not been a meer stranger to all our old Historians, he would not so ignorantly ask, what Legend I had this Fable out of? His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration we see doth not teach him all things. And the History of <hi>Wilfrid</hi> related but now, fully proves that the Pope had no Patriarchal Jurisdiction here. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice,</hi> it reckoned the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> among the four great Patriarchs, but doth not give him any power over those who were not at that time subject to him, and it is certain the British Church almost 300 years after, professed they owed no subjection to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor had they ever paid any; and the Council of <hi>Ephesus, Ann.</hi> 431. had prohibited Patriarchs enlarging their bounds, or bringing any Churches under their Subjection, which had not formerly been under them; so that our Protestant Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors prove, that the Pope broke those Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of general Councils, when in the after Ages he did usurp a Power over <hi>Britain,</hi> see <hi>Basire</hi> Libert. of <hi>Britan</hi> Churches, and <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> of <hi>Schism. pag.</hi> 50. But the Quaker wickedly abuses <hi>Perkins</hi> in citing him to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy Pope <hi>Gregories</hi> Patriarchal power over <hi>England,</hi> for his words are, <hi>The Pope had not power to make Laws or to dispense with them out of his own Province for</hi> 600 <hi>years.</hi> Gregory <hi>dispensed with the English about prohibited de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; but he did this as a Patriarch, yea he did it by directive power, not by command or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi> Perk. <hi>pag.</hi> 204. Where we see he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:200297:166"/> the Pope did this by vertue of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and though he saith he was a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch, yet he doth not say he did it as their Patriarch; and the design of <hi>Perkins</hi> there is plainly to shew it was Counsel not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand he gave them; yet this will serve <hi>T. E.</hi> to make his Quakers believe the English Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy were subject to the Pope then. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He confesses he knows not what I mean by their being <hi>a Church of themselves;</hi> and the reason is because he knows nothing of the Primitive times nor phrases, for of old some National Churches were not under any one of the Patriarchs, but divers had <gap reason="foreign">

So that still the Church of <hi>England</hi> to which Tithes were given, was not then subject to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and as I have proved their King was not a Papist, so by the same Arguments they are cleared of that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation; and since the Quaker doth but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat his former bafled calumnies, I shall not enlarge my Answer by imitating him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating my replies.

               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 227. But indeed all this is imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the Question, since if they had been Papists, the Donation had not been invalid, for that was made to God, and Tithes were given to maintain his Service; now what is given to Pious and Charitable uses is not to be taken away because the persons enjoying it hold wrong Opinions, for if so, then all the Hospitals founded in times of Popery, and given to Popish poor Men and Women, would be <hi>ipso facto</hi> to be taken away; which
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:200297:167"/> is a most false and wicked principle: And if the Donations to Hospitals and to Popish Poor be valid, so is the donation of Tithes to a Popish Clergy; the persons must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, but what is once given to God may not be recalled. <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> were strook dead for revoking part of that which they themselves had but intentionally dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Acts</hi> v. 1.2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Much less can any man excuse those who have taken Parochial Tithes thus dedicated by others from the guilt of Sacriledge. But at present let it be considered these were the only publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of God in that Age; these prayed for the People, preached and administred the Holy Sacraments unto them, and since they were to reward their Teachers with a part of all their Goods, <hi>Galat.</hi> vi. 9. were they not bound to give to these? And had they not Primitive practice and innumerable examples to incline them to give the Tenth part? Let the Quaker tell us what other Teachers they had, and if there were any Errors afterward crept in among these, those Errors are to be rectified, and the Teachers reformed; but the Gift being perpetual and intended for such as taught the people by publick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, so long as there are such Teachers, the Gift is not to be taken away; much less when the Teachers have renounced all those Popish Errors which are the ground of <hi>T.E</hi>'s. scruple. Nor do I doubt to affirm but if the Turks were converted to Christianity, a Council of Christians would certainly decree
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:200297:168"/> that those Tithes which the Turks now strictly pay to their Mahometan Priests, ought to be continued for the Maintenance of their Priests when they were turned Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. The Scripture, Fathers, Councils and all Antiquity assure us that Tithes ought to be given to the Christian Ministers, and they were given to them by our Ancestors for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity; and therefore as long as there are Christian Ministers they will be due. And as the faults of the Jewish Priests in Opinion and Practice did not forfeit their Right to Tithes; so neither did the Popery of latter Clergy forfeit their Right, and whereas <hi>T.E.</hi> saith the Jewish Clergy were Ordained by God, and so were not <hi>Ethelwolfs;</hi> I reply, the Jewish Clergy when so corrupted were Ordained by men succeding those whom God at first Ordained, and so were <hi>Ethelwolfs</hi> C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rgy too; both their Ordinations were mediate and humane, and by succession; but 'tis more evident that the Jewish Priests were more corrupted than the Saxon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they retained their Right to Tithes, much more did these retain theirs; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they cannot forfeit our Right who so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly renounce all Popish Doctrines when we are invested with Tithes. But perhaps one case may clear this whole matter: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>T. E.</hi> be seized of some Lands discharged of Tithes by reason these Lands were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belonging to the <hi>Cistertian</hi> Order; no doubt he believes his Exemption to be good and valid, and yet it is certain that this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:200297:168"/> was a Grant made to a Popish Clergy, who were then Owners of these Lands, and even those who seem most zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous against Popery, do plead these Grants in bar to all demands of Tithes; now if a Grant to a Popish Clergy to exempt from Tithes be valid, and no less valid because for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made to a Popish Clergy, especially now the Lands are enjoyed by those who are no profest Papists; then a Grant to confirm Tithes to a Popish Clergy is valid, and no less valid because formerly made to such a Clergy since now the Tithes are enjoyed by professed Protestants; and the Quakers Arguments to destroy the Donation of Tithes, effectually destroy all these exemptions.</p>
               <p n="14">§. 14. PAg. 233. His Third Objection is, that this Donation was made upon Evil Motives, and one of his instances is, that they gave them for the good of their Souls. And when I justly reproved him for calling this an Evil Motive, he thinks to wipe of the Nonsense thereof, by another saying equally absurd, <hi>viz. That to be moved to do a good work simply, is not an Evil Motive;</hi> if he mean by [simply] without any Motive at all, then it is all one as if he had said, where there is no Motive there is no Evil Motive; but if by [simply] he means meerly for the sake of the good work it self, that reaches not the Case, for <hi>Ethelwolfs</hi> Motive (he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses) was <hi>for the good of his Soul,</hi> and verily
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:200297:169"/> that was a good Motive, and none but he that is very simple would call it otherwise. But he cites the Historians who record the Charter, and saith they mention his doing it, <hi>for the remission of our Sins.</hi> And this he reckons to be an Evil Motive. I reply that there is great reason to suspect the later Monks put the phrase of their own times into this old Charter, because of the variety found among them in this very clause, for only <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulphus</hi> and <hi>Math.</hi> of <hi>Westminster</hi> have it as the Quaker cites it, <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> (as <hi>T. E.</hi> confesses) hath <hi>for the Redemption of his Soul and of his Ancestors,</hi> but he is mistaken in saying <hi>Hoveden</hi> agrees with him, for <hi>Hove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> follows <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> and they both phrase it, <hi>for the love of God and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of himself. Histor.</hi> Angl. <hi>p.</hi> Bed. <hi>pag.</hi> 200. <hi>(a)</hi> and <hi>pag.</hi> 237. <hi>(b)</hi> And <hi>Malmsbury</hi> hath no more than this, <hi>for the remission of his Soul.</hi> Now it being so usual with later Monks to write of elder things in the phrase of their own times, and (as <hi>Malmsbury</hi> confesses, <hi>lib. de gest. Reg. pag.</hi> 15.) sometimes to put in their own words, 'tis very probable there might be no such words at all in <hi>Ethelwolfs</hi> Original Charter: but supposing there were some words of this import, we must interpret them by the Opinion of that Age; and men of greater Note and Learning too in matters of Divinity than either of those cited by <hi>T. E.</hi> do assure us, that the Doctrine of Merit in the present Popish sense was not held for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Centuries after, I quoted an Archbishop
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:200297:169"/> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and a Pope, <hi>Anselm</hi> and <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> together with St. <hi>Bernard (de Tempore Serm.</hi> 48.) and <hi>Durandus</hi> (in <hi>Sent. l.</hi> 2. <hi>dist.</hi> 28. <hi>qu.</hi> 1.) the one a Father, the other a School-man; and by these four I proved that Meriting Salvation by Good-works was not held for some hundred years after <hi>Ethelwolf.</hi> The Quaker replies, <hi>we must not regard so much the private Judgment of one or few particular persons, as what was the general Opinion of the then Church.</hi> And yet he cites no other but two late and private persons, <hi>viz. Fox</hi> and <hi>Cambden,</hi> and the latter not writing as a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, but barely relating things out of the old Monks as a Historian. Now I suppose <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selm</hi> and <hi>Adrian,</hi> St. <hi>Bernard</hi> and <hi>Durandus,</hi> are much more likely to declare what then was the Opinion of the Church, than two late Historians. But if this do not satisfy <hi>T. E.</hi> he may consult Bishop <hi>Ʋsher</hi> in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Jesuites challenge; where he will find it positively affirmed that the Popish Doctrine of Merits was not held in the Church for more than a Thousand years after Christ, and divers eminent Authors in every Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury cited at large to prove that Assertion, Answ. to Challenge <hi>pag.</hi> 508. 509. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or if he will sooner believe his so Celebrated Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> he tells us, <hi>that Merit properly taken for that which is of Desert, was not received by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox in the Church for</hi> 1000 <hi>years after Christ.</hi> Dem. probl. <hi>p.</hi> 106. And he spends divers pages to prove that among the Antients the word was never used in the Popish sense, <hi>pag.</hi> 107,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:200297:170"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And concerning the word [Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on] he saith, <hi>in this manner Alms are said to be satisfaction, not that they are the price of our Sins before God, but the signs of a true and sincere Repentance, and according to this Opinion (saith he) the Antients speak.</hi> id. ibid. pag. 170. And he proves further, that they believed Christ Merits only properly satisfied, but these good works being Signs of true Repentance, and real deprecations of pardon, crying as it were to God for mercy, did often prevail for Remission, and so were improperly called Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions, because upon beholding them God did through Christ grant Remission, and declare himself no longer angry at the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; to this purpose doth Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> fairly Expound those Phrases, and clear the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the Quakers false aspersion of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And this takes away the very subject of his Cavil, and shews Tithes were not given upon Evil Motives, but among the rest, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this for one, that the Piety of a Gift so pleasing to God, might testify their true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and move the Almighty for <hi>Jesus</hi> sake to grant them Remission of their Sins, and deliverance from his Anger; and that they did take in the Merits and Satisfaction of Christ, and hope only by his Death to have their own good works accepted in order to a Pardon, may appear from <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi>'s manner of relating it, who saith King <hi>Ethelwolf offered up his Tithe to the Trin-une God for a never ceasing Deed of gift, upon the Cross of Christ, for the redemption of his
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:200297:170"/> Soul, and of his Ancestors. ap.</hi> Selden. <hi>Hist. Tithes. pag.</hi> 205. Which words (upon the Cross of Christ) <hi>T. E.</hi> craftily left out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they shew the innocent meaning of that Age.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 238. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As for his strugling to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse himself and other Quakers from being more guilty of holding the Popish Doctrine of Merit, I shall only say, that <hi>T. E.</hi> is plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that 97 page of his first Book, for a state of freedom from Sin in this Life to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and he gives this for the reason why there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus; because there is no sin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by them, adding, <hi>for wheresoever there is Sin, there is also Condemnation,</hi> which I think plainly shews he doth not think Christ's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits or Death can save a Sinner from Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but it must be his own actual free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from Sin that must save him. And I can name to him one Quaker who saith, <hi>that true Religion may be without the knowledge and belief of the History of Christs Death.</hi> G. Keith <hi>Immed. Revel. pag.</hi> 229. And another that saith, <hi>the Righteousness by Faith (which Saint</hi> Paul <hi>saith justifies us) is when the Law is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in us by the work of the Spirit</hi>— and a little after — <hi>Righteousness, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Salvation is received in Christ the the Light, through Obedience to the Light within.</hi> Whitehead's <hi>Nat. of Christianity pag.</hi> 30. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And another saith, <hi>It is the Devil that tells men, Christ died for all, and if they can but
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:200297:171"/> lay hold on him by Faith, he will not impute their Sins unto them, though they sin daily,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi>'s Shield of Truth. <hi>pag.</hi> 98. But let their Sense be what it will, I am not concerned fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to shew there is cause to fear some Quakers do more derogate from Christs Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Cross, than ever <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> or his Clergy did, whom <hi>T. E.</hi> cannot otherwise prove to be Papists, than by barely repeating his old bafled Catalogues of Romish Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which he falsly ascribes to that Age. And we have now shewed the Motives were not Evil nor contrary to Protestant Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples on which they give Tithes; though (as I shewed before in my 108 page and 109) if the Motives had been Evil, that had not made the Donation invalid, for then must all Schools and Hospitals, and all Grants and Charters (<hi>Magna Charta</hi> not excepted) be made void, if made in times of gross Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; because in all probability they were led to make and grant them by Evil Motives. And besides I noted that Evil Motives only take off from the Givers reward in Heaven, not from the Validity of the Gift on Earth; and if no Gift were good but that which was given on good Motives (since no man knows the Heart) none can tell even of Protestant Gifts which were valid and which not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause none knows the true Motives leading the Giver to any Gift. <hi>T. E.</hi> was too much in hast to answer any of this; from his silence therefore, I conclude, that if the Motives were Evil, the Gift may be good and valid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men.</p>

                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:200297:171"/>§. 15. PAg. 242. Having thus shewed the weakness of these objections, and how ill able my Adversary is, to make out his Charge Popery; as also how little it would signify to the Question if he could have made it good: I must resolve to be very brief in my reply to his tedious harpings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same string, and desire the Reader to consider that these very <hi>Saxons</hi> did pay Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to their King, and give Alms to the Poor, did make Laws for Catechizing and Preaching, and for the Religious Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Seventh part of their Time, as well as for the pious Dedication of the Tenth part of their Estates; and since their Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious Opinions and Practices (supposing them as gross as <hi>T. E.</hi> pretends) did not make those Good Acts become Evil or Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, no more would they do the giving of Tithes: So that I conceive my Question will be in the same state, whatever becomes of the <hi>Saxons</hi> Opinions in other matters. Yet that he may not too much insult; I will make some reflections on these <hi>Sallies.</hi> And first, it can no ways hurt the Donation of Tithes, that the receivers of them gratefully and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily engaged to pray for their Benefact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors. And the name of [Masses] which is used in <hi>Malmsbury</hi> and <hi>Mathew</hi> of <hi>Westminster,</hi> hath no such evil signification as the Quaker either out of Ignorance or Malice pretends; for that the saying two Masses cannot signify
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:200297:172"/> the Offering up Christ's real body and saying over the whole Office, may appear in that it was then forbid by the Canons of the Church for any Priest to say more than one Mass in in one day. <hi>Except.</hi> Egberti. <hi>Can.</hi> 54. and long after <hi>Ethelwolfs</hi> time Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond affirms, <hi>that they who for Money presume to say more, cannot (in his Judgment) escape Damnation.</hi> Alex. 2. <hi>Ann.</hi> 1061. <hi>ap.</hi> Bin. <hi>T.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 64. So that by two Masses here, we must understand two Prayers or two Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects; and for further confirmation of this Sense, the very Titles of these two Masses or Prayers are set down in <hi>Malmsbury.</hi> viz. <hi>Deus, qui justificas,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Praetende Domine,</hi> the last of which Collects I have found at large, and shall set it down, to shew there is nothing either of Popery or Corruption in it, and 'tis this, <hi>Stretch out, O Lord, to thy faithful Servants the Right Hand of thy Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Aid, that they may seek Thee with their whole Heart, and that what things they fitly ask, they may have grace to obtain through Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi> Sacr. <hi>Greg.</hi> pag. 385. And that such single Prayers were then called Masses, may be seen in that Law of King <hi>Ethelred;</hi> which commands that <hi>one Mass be every day said for the King and his People,</hi> in the Morning-Mass, which is intitled, <hi>Against the Pagans,</hi> Leg. <hi>Ethelr.</hi> Cap. 3. <hi>ap.</hi> Spelm.

And of this significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Mass</hi> for a <hi>Prayer,</hi> the learned Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Bona</hi> gives divers instances, <hi>rer. Liturg.

Yea Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> also himself saith, <hi>In the Council of</hi> Milevis, <hi>c.</hi> 12. <hi>Prayers and Masses are put for the same thing, and therefore (saith he) the name of [Mass] sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified otherwise of old than it doth now.</hi> Dem. prob. <hi>pag.</hi> 142. And that same Author in a large Disputation there proves, that <hi>the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and real Sacrifice of Christ in the Mass, as it is a propitiation for quick and dead in the hands of the Priest, was not received in the Church for</hi> 1200 <hi>years after Christ.</hi> Idem. ib. <hi>pag.</hi> 136. &amp;c. So that <hi>T. E.</hi> mistakes the Mark in all his long Harangue about the Roman Mass, and how corrupt soever that was, 'tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to this matter; because these Priests only engaged to say two innocent Prayers for their Benefactors: Yet I will note that he is out, even in his Accounts of the Roman Mass also, for that Mass of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great (as the Learned know) differed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely much from the modern Roman Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, being free from innumerable of the Corruptions added to it in after Ages: And for that Council which he pretends at <hi>Rome</hi> enjoyning it to be universally received; <hi>Bini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> remembers no such Council, and <hi>Duran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> out of whom <hi>T. E.</hi> cites the story, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions no Council, but only quotes the Legend of <hi>S.

<pb n="296" facs="tcp:200297:173"/> to follow strictly the Roman Office, but to take what he found most fit in any Church, and prescribe it to the English Church, and particularly recommended to him the way of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, which then much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from the Roman. <hi>Spel.</hi> T. 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 96. <hi>Bona</hi> rer.

Nor is there any good Authority that <hi>Austins</hi> Liturgy was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered for that of <hi>Gregory,</hi> till <hi>Osmund</hi> Bishop of <hi>Sarum,</hi> who to remove that great variety of Prayers and Offices then every where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding, reduced all to one form (taking the Roman <hi>Missal</hi> for his Pattern) which was called the Use of <hi>Sarum, Kanulph.</hi> Polychr. <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>Ann.</hi> 1077. <hi>Harpsfield</hi> Hist.

E.</hi> calls the <hi>Song</hi> of <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Fischam,</hi> 'tis very likely it was not a different Office, but another way of singing it, divers from the Roman or Gregorian way of singing, for it will be hard to prove that <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Fischam</hi> ever composed a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Mass; and if it were contrary to <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories</hi> Mass, how came it to be used in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> which was a part of <hi>France,</hi> where <hi>T. E.</hi> tells us <hi>Charles</hi> the Great had set up <hi>Gregories</hi> Mass? And if it be thus (for 'tis not worth my while to examine the History) then it is not unlikely that the Church of <hi>England</hi> before the Conquest might sing their own Liturgy in <hi>Gregorie</hi>'s way of singing. However this is certain, that those Masses then, were far more pure than those of the present Roman Church; and whatever Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:200297:173"/> Conceits private Men might have, it is plain that Purgatory and Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Popish Sense were not believed as Articles of Faith for many Ages after.</p>

And why might not some of the Monks do in the same manner with <hi>Ethelwolfs</hi> Charter? Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Mathew</hi> of <hi>Westminster,</hi> who, contrary to all other Authors, puts the words [<hi>blessed</hi> Mary <hi>and all the Saints</hi>] into the body of the Charter; and the words that <hi>T. E.</hi> cites out of <hi>Ingulphus,</hi> are only the words of that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and no part of the Charter, which he gives us intire; and when he hath concluded it then he adds of his own, that this was offered up — <hi>for the Honour of</hi> Mary, &amp;c. which was the Custom in Donations in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulphus</hi> time, but not in <hi>Ethelwolf</hi>'s, for the Donations of that Age which are faithfully set down, have no names of Saints at all: see the Charter of <hi>Withlasius Ann.</hi> 833. <hi>Spelm.</hi> T. 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 346. But as to the extent of <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wolfs</hi> Charter, in which <hi>T. E.</hi> also saith there is a variety among the Relators, there the <hi>Major</hi> part, by far, agree that it was for all <hi>England.

And yet if they had been so Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious, as to joyn the names of the Saints to the name of God in the very Charter it self, that would not invalidate the Grant of so Pious a thing as the purest Times and most Orthodox Fathers had declared Tithes to be. For indeed there were scarce any Charters e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made to Cities, Hospitals, Schools, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> between <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror and <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, which had not the names of Saints so joyned with the name of God; yet no man in his Wits will say that therefore they are all void.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 250. My Friend and I both, have shewed that Scripture and Primitive Fathers had asserted the Right of Tithes, and it was the wisdom of the <hi>Saxons</hi> to act by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of such Guides, wherefore it could be no blind zeal, nor doth my Friend (as the Quaker falsly suggests) say, that <hi>this Donation proceeded from invincible Ignorance,</hi> but only, that if there were any defects in the Charter (as perhaps there might be) we must not esteem him a damnable Idolater for doing a thing in an ill manner through invincible Ignorance. It was not the thing,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:200297:175"/> but the ill Manner of doing of it (supposing it were done in such ill manner) which he affirms proceeded from invincible Ignorance in <hi>Ethelwolf;</hi> and the Quaker doth apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calumniate him, in that he strains his words to another Sense. As for the Ministry to whom the Donation was made, I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved they had no dependance on <hi>Rome,</hi> nor were they a Popish Clergy; and <hi>T. E.</hi> is a notorious Falsifyer to say, <hi>He hath proved by the Testimony of divers approved Authors that they were a Popish Priesthood;</hi> for not one of his Authors saith any such word: They were Gods only publick Ministers in this Nation, and the lawful Teachers of that People who gave Tithes, and were not considered as to their private Opinions, but as to their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. If these who bore this Office afterward by degrees fell to hold Corrupt Opinions, and at the Reformation the whole Order was amended and made to renounce those Opinions again; the Office remained the same all the while, and the now removed Corruptions must not be objected to those of this Age; and since there is still a publick Ministry, the Donation remains good to those who are in this Office at this very day; and by the way I must tell him that no Popish Priests that ever I heard of, were so properly the Ministers of Antichrist, as those Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Speakers, <hi>Pen</hi> and others, who expresly deny the Trinity, the Divinity of our Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> and the expiation of Sin by his Death upon the Cross. If Saint <hi>John</hi>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:200297:175"/> be in the right, these are Antichrist in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. 1. <hi>John</hi> iv. 2. and 2 <hi>Ephesians</hi> ver. 7.</p>
               <p n="17">§. 17. PAg. 253. Here <hi>T. E.</hi> labours hard to excuse himself, from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busing my Friend in perverting his words, and from discovering his own folly in his non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence about the Censers; but first let me ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that he runs from the Matter to glean up sentences here and there, about the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Donors, whether that will sanctify a Gift to a false God; for that is not the Case of Tithes, as my friend states it, which he supposes given to the True God: and did not <hi>T. E.</hi> abuse him to extend his meaning to Gifts given to false Gods, and a false Ministry? It is no matter what his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion and mine are in case of Dedications to a false God or a false Ministry, for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry here is, whether the Quaker did not wilfully pervert my Friends meaning in this place? And that is so evident, that whoever will compare the two Books will see that he hath done this. But as to that Query, <hi>viz.</hi> whether things Dedicated to an Evil Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship ought to be Alienated? The Quaker shall hear his own Doctors Opinion, <hi>If they be given through Ignorance of the time to such unlawful purposes; they ought by the Princes to be converted to better and more Godly uses.</hi> Willet. <hi>Synop. pag.</hi> 310. and <hi>pag.</hi> 311. he saith, <hi>Tithes cannot be Alienated to any other use, or turned to the Maintenance of Lay-men.</hi>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:200297:176"/> For indeed he doth with us and with the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Fathers believe, Tithes were dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the true God for the Maintenance of his Gospel Ministry, and therefore no ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish in the ill manner of the Dedication can make them cease to belong to God and his Church. And the case of the Censers is so far parallel to this, that though they were Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by men who committed a most hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Sin in that Act which made them Holy, and the parties who Offered, designed (like our Quakers) to abolish the distinction which God had made between Priests and People, yea to overthrow the very Office it self, yet God would not allow these Censers Dedicated in so ill a manner to be Alienated. How much more then ought not Tithes to be alienated, which were Dedicated to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Priesthood and the Service of God? And the worst that can be said of the manner of Offering them, was that the Offerors held some Superstitious Opinions. This is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Parallel, and yet such an one as affords ground for an Argument, <hi>a majori ad minus;</hi> the cases differ in this, that the Dedication of the Censers was done in a worse manner than that of Tithes, yet both (as we are content to suppose at present) in an Evil manner; but the Censers may not be alienated; <hi>Ergo,</hi> much less may Tithes. And for the Quakers long Harangue about this, he poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begs the Question all the way, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Sense of the whole Catholick Church for 1500 years, supposes that Tithes
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:200297:176"/> ought not to be Dedicated under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and upon this bafled mistake is all that heap of Tautologies built, which fill up his 258, 259, 260, and 261. pages. And since I have proved by Scripture, Reason and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that Tithes ought to be Dedicated now, as well as Censers then; it follows, that Tithes may not be alienated now, no more than Censers then. And let it be noted, the Censers of those Sinners whose alienation God forbids, were not Dedicated by Gods Command, but only by a voluntary Act of the men who Offered with them; so that it seems, a voluntary Dedication of any thing to God, even though it were not grounded on any express command of God, makes the thing uncapable of being employed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane uses afterward. If God have the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, that Property must not be altered, they may be used to this or that Holy use as God directs, but the turning the Censers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another form, and using them to another (but still to a Holy) use, did not, as <hi>T. E.</hi> pretends, alter the Property at all, the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of which expression he hath not yet cleared himself from. And for his vile sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion that the Clergy got Tithes by fraud, 'tis notoriously false, for even in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Times, which cannot (without great impudence and dishonesty) be accused of Evil Acts, Tithes were frequently and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given, and this Donation of <hi>Ethelwolfs</hi> was his own voluntary Act, with the full and free consent of all the Estates of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:200297:177"/> and it was confirmed in every Age af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, having been all along believed by the Faithful, to be a Duty which God required of them. And if the Clergy of that Age did teach the <hi>Saxons</hi> from Scripture and Fathers, from Reason and Example, that it was so; they dealt most truly therein, and rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them of the Opinion of the best Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in this matter, and it had been fraud to have concealed this; but was no other than what truth and Conscience obliged them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, to teach them that which was right in this Case.</p>
               <p n="18">§. 18. PAg. 262. Our Opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the unlawfulness of alienating Tithes, <hi>T. E.</hi> did endeavour to render odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, by telling the Impropriators that this concerned them, and that it followed from hence that it was unlawful for them to hold their Impropriations, and therefore he bids them look to themselves: see his First Book <hi>p.</hi> 297. Yet here he would gladly deny his flattering the Impropriators, and exaspera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them against us, and to colour that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial the better, when he comes to repeat his own words he craftily leaves out these [I need not I suppose tell the Impropriators that this concerns them] which is meer double dealing. For my part I have freely spoken my Sense of Impropriations, <hi>pag.</hi> 118, and 119. And since the Quaker hath not argued against that, I shall refer the Reader thither.
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:200297:177"/> only note at present, that those Quakers which have Estates in Impropriations, are not convinced by <hi>T. E</hi>'s. Arguments to quit their Rights to them.. As for Abby-Lands it is besides my Question to discourse of them, yet I know there was no Scripture nor Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Authority to oblige men to give those Lands, as there was for giving of Tithes.</p>
               <p>And besides the whole Order of Monks and Nuns, the very Office was wholly Extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the Reformation; whereas the Order and Office of Priests was still continued, and therefore it was not so bad to alienate the Lands belonging to an Office not set up by God, nor endowed by his command, and now wholly laid aside, as it would be to alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the Tithes belonging to an Office of Gods Institution, given by his Command, while the Office is in being, and both needs and deserves them. But still it may be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the Parliament which consented to these Alienations of Abby-Lands, did it upon a Solemn promise from the King, that he would employ those Lands to the Glory of God and the Weal of his People, and they expected that the King would have employed them for publick acts of Charity, and to ease the people of Assessments towards the Poor, and the common defence, as also for providing liberally for a preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ministry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which shews that they believed, these Abby-Lands also should have been put to other good uses for the publick benefit; but not so loosly dispersed into
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:200297:178"/> Lay-hands as they were, without any regard to those Pious and Charitable uses designed by the consentors to the Alienation. But whatever be the Opinion of the Clergy in these Matters, they submit to the Laws, and pay unto all their dues, without disturbing the Government, not pretending Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to save Charges, as the Quakers do as often as they meet with a Parson who will rather put up his wrong than be at the trouble and cost of a Sute at Law against them; and many such persons I know, who think the Remedy worse than the Disease, and rather compound for half value (which the Quaker will do by a Neighbour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) than take the real advantage the Law gives them; and these Quakers under such a Minister may justly be said to pretend Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to save charges.</p>
               <p n="19">§. 19. PAg. 265. This Section hath lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle new Matter, but what is answered before, where I have proved that Tithes are no part of Popery, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the <hi>Saxons</hi> had been Popish in other Opinions, in this they were of the same Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Primitive Fathers; and we may as well condemn their Laws for obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Lords day, for learning the Creed and the Lords Prayer, their Alms-deeds, and condemning of Images, as their giving of Tithes, to which last instances <hi>T. E.</hi> replies not at all. And for his sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:200297:178"/> that Popery began by degrees, it makes nothing to his purpose, because while the Popish Opinions were only the fancies of privatemen, and neither imposed nor gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally believed; surely this could not make an Age so bad that all their publick Acts relate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Religion must thereby be made inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid; and if Popery was but creeping in, in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelwolf</hi>'s time, Tithes were then fully esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, &amp; received no addition but only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations afterwards; so that Tithes were at highest while Popery was (even accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>T. E.</hi>) but in the beginning, and thererefore Tithes were no effect of Popery. As for the Mystery of Iniquity which the Quaker talks of, I am sure it works very vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly in that Sect, who divide us and expose us to the Popish designs, and who date the rise of Popery so high, that they may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the People, that the Religion now e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished by Law is Popish, and under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Popish Institutions, teach them to reject Baptism and the Lords Supper, the Letter of Scripture, the calling of Ministers and Tithes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Christ himself hath either enjoyned or allowed; and if ever Popery come in upon us, all sober Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants confess that it must enter in at that breach which these Seditious Sectaries have made, who are so malicious that we see they will rather do their feeble endeavour, to prove the Popes Authority over <hi>England</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver since the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, (see <hi>T.E.</hi> pag. 224.) than want some Dirt to throw at
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:200297:179"/> Tithes. But if he hath any shame he will blush at his weak vapour, pag. 269. now that I have vindicated those ancient Authorities, and shewed his ignorance and dishonesty in questioning or denying them. For I have proved Tithes as old as <hi>Origen,</hi> and <hi>T. E.</hi> cannot prove Popery so old, no not in any one peculiar Opinion of it, and therefore to be sure Tithes did not spring from Popery; and however the Quaker bespatters <hi>Origen,</hi> he is a good Witness when he speaks for him, pag. 274. And let <hi>T. E.</hi> note, that neither <hi>Perkins,</hi> nor St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> thought this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Tithes to be any of his Errors; for they both agreed with <hi>Origen</hi> in that Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As for <hi>Origens</hi> Purgatory, <hi>Perkins</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly shews it was not the Popish Purgatory, as was declared before. So that still Tithes are elder than Popery, and <hi>T. E</hi>'s. attempt to prove them Popish is altogether in vain.</p>
               <p n="20">§. 20. PAg. 261. Having proved Tithes to be asserted, decreed, and paid as well in this, as in other Christian Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es so long before <hi>Ethelwolf,</hi> it will not prove them to be Popish, supposing <hi>T. E.</hi> could make it out that the Age of <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> did hold some Popish Opinions; however <hi>ex abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danti</hi> I spent one Page to shew that most of those Doctrines properly called Popery were not held as Articles of Faith, no not at <hi>Rome</hi> it self, <hi>Ann.</hi> 855. And I gave some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances; as</p>
               <pb n="309" facs="tcp:200297:179"/>
               <p>First, That the Marriage of Priests was not forbid till the time of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth above 200 years after <hi>Ethelwolf,</hi> ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for this <hi>Polydore Virgil. T. E.</hi> after a tedious quotation of 2 or 3 Pages out of that Author, exclaims against me for bringing him to witness this Assertion of mine (for I did not cite <hi>Polydores</hi> words) and yet, as he hath quoted them, they do affirm the same thing which I meant, <hi>viz. That Marriages could not be taken away from the Western Priests before the time of Pope</hi> Gregory <hi>the Seventh,</hi> Ann. 1074. And surely we cannot properly say it was received as an Article of Faith in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, till those of that Church did believe it and obey it? 'Tis true some of the Popes favoured the Coelibate of Priests, but the Church opposed them in it; and we can scarce count a thing forbidden, till it be forbidden <hi>cum effectu,</hi> that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, till it be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred: and in Scripture it self [to forbid] is put for [to hinder,] <hi>Acts</hi> x. 47. <hi>Ch.</hi> xxviii. 31. and the word which is there translated [forbid] is elsewhere turned by [Hindred or Let] <hi>Luke</hi> xi. 52. <hi>Rom.</hi> i. 13. and [not suffered] <hi>Hebr.</hi> vii. 23. But not to contend about words, if the word [forbidden] were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient, I am less concerned, since the thing I intended is most true, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of Priests was not taken away in the Western Church, nor their Single Life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as an Article of Faith, till about 200 years after <hi>Ethelwolf,</hi> and of this <hi>Polydore</hi> is a good Witness. As for the Decree of <hi>Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:200297:180"/> circ. Ann. 387. Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> himself not only saith it is of doubtfull credit, but form the Barbarism of the Stile &amp; Imperious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Orders in it, proves it to be spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, <hi>Demonst. Problem.</hi> pag. 33. Which shews <hi>T. E</hi>'s. Dishonesty in citing this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree out of <hi>Perkins,</hi> and attempting to prove it genuine, when he saw (no doubt) that <hi>Perkins</hi> flatly condemns it; but it was for his interest to overlook this. The Decree of <hi>Pelagius</hi> was not admitted (as <hi>Polydore</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses) when it was made, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by his Successor <hi>Gregory</hi> as unjust; and contrary to the Gospel, (saith <hi>Polydore</hi>) and the same <hi>Gregory</hi> advised <hi>Austin</hi> to let some of the Clergy who could not contain, to have Wives. <hi>Resp. ad</hi> 2. <hi>interrog.</hi> Aug. Spelm. T. 1. pag. 99. And that Decree in <hi>Polydore</hi> ascribed to him is of no credit, so that the Author confesses some attribute it to <hi>Eugenius</hi> who lived 50 years after. And the first Council he names, being the Synod of <hi>Melda,</hi> was not held till <hi>Ann.</hi> 845. nor is there any one Canon that I can find in it to forbid Priests Marriage. And for this Nation, 'tis sure the <hi>British</hi> Clergy had Wives, which were ordered to go vailed. <hi>Syn. Patric.</hi> Can. 6. <hi>Ann.</hi> 456. And not only the <hi>Saxon</hi> Priests, but divers of their Monks also had Wives, as I have proved before, and King <hi>Edgar</hi> was the first who laboured to impose <hi>Coelibate</hi> on the Monks here. <hi>Ann.</hi> 975. which was 120 years after <hi>Ethelwolf.</hi> And yet the Priests here did generally retain their Wives
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:200297:180"/> till long after the Conquest. <hi>Spelm.</hi> T. 2. pag. 22. 23. And one old Historian says, <hi>That all the Decrees to the contrary prevailed nothing, for All (by the Kings leave) enjoyed their Wives, as formerly they had done, Histor.</hi> Petroburg. <hi>Ann.</hi> 1127. And Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> proves very largely that it was allowed by some Popes and Councils, and connived at by others in other Nations long after <hi>Gregories</hi> time; and that here in <hi>England</hi> they had Wives many years after <hi>Ethelwolf</hi>'s Death, yea that they were never sorbidden to have them till the year 1100. So that even Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> himself hath said enough to shew Priests Marriages were not generally forbidden in the Western Church, till long after Tithes were granted, as the Quaker may see to his full satisfaction, <hi>Dem. Problem.</hi> pag. 193, 194, 195, 196 and 197. And therefore the Church was not corrupted with Popery in that point when this Donation was made.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The number of the Seven Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (I affirmed) was not defined till Pope <hi>Lombards</hi> daies, which I proved by the Testimony of <hi>Cassander,</hi> a Papist (esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Evidence against themselves to be most of all to be believed). <hi>T. E.</hi> avoids this by saying he had not the Book. But he hath Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> his <hi>Demonstratio Problem.</hi> and there he might have read the same thing, <hi>viz.</hi> Lombard <hi>and the School-men after him were the first that said there were Seven Sacraments of the Church.</hi> pag. 125. But 'tis plain he resolves to acknowledg nothing, though never so true,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:200297:181"/> which he thinks makes against him; a clear proof that he disputes not for Truth, but to uphold an interest right or wrong. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this point is clear, that the Popish Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Seven Sacraments came in near 300 years after Tithes were given.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He confesses what I was to prove, <hi>viz.</hi> That Transubstantiation was not by publick Decrees imposed as an Article of Faith till the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council; and though <hi>Perkins</hi> say Disputations about it began <hi>Ann.</hi> 840. yet a thing is not received in the Church so soon as some first began to dispute concerning it, and in that very place <hi>Perkins</hi> adds, <hi>that it was not agreed on till the</hi> Lateran <hi>Council under</hi> Innocent <hi>the Third</hi> (viz. 350 <hi>years after</hi> Ethelwolf;) which clause▪ <hi>T. E.</hi> more cunningly than honestly twice leaves out, where he cites the very words preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz.</hi> pag. 247. and 275. But that Parochial payment of Tithes is much elder than the Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> under <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, <hi>Selden</hi> himself dares not deny; <hi>Hist. Tithes.</hi> Chap. x. §. 2. And I can prove that the ix. Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> Ann. 1122. (near 100 years before this under <hi>Innocent</hi>) declares Tithes to be due to Parish-Priests; and the Tenth Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> Ann. 1139. <hi>Can.</hi> 10. as also the eleventh, <hi>Ann.</hi> 1180. <hi>Can.</hi> 23 (and in the Appendexes) do plainly assert Parochial Right; so that there are (besides particular Canons very Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent) even Councils called General, declaring for Parochial Right of Tithes, long before
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:200297:181"/> the very first Decree for Transubstantiation. And when Tithes were given, <hi>Rome</hi> it self did not receive that Popish Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Purgatory was but a private O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, as a good Historian confesses, <hi>Ann.</hi> 1146. And <hi>Perkins</hi> cites this very saying of the same <hi>Otto</hi> with approbation, pag. 177. shewing that the Purgatory held by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients was not the <hi>Romish</hi> Purgatory; and he much doubts whether that were received so soon as the year 600. for indeed those Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues, which seem to make <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, the Author of it; <hi>Perkins</hi> thinks are spurious (pag. 38. and pag. 179.) shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there that this <hi>Gregory</hi> in his genuine wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings overthrows the Popish Purgatory; the very Foundation whereof Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> affirms was not received in the Church for 1100 years after Christ. And the Bishop of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> (a Martyr for Popery) whom I cited before, confesses that Indulgences did but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin after men had for a good while feared Purgatory. So that both Purgatory and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences in the Popish Sense were not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Church for divers Ages after Tithes were given here; Purgatory being not defined in any Council till <hi>Concil. Florent.</hi> Ann. 1436. and Indulgences not till the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> Sess. 25. As for the Half-Communion, and equalling the Apocrypha to the Canonical Scripture; <hi>T. E.</hi> doth not once attempt to prove them elder than I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, so that the Church was free of those points of Popery also in the Age of K. <hi>Ethel.</hi> and long after.</p>
               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:200297:182"/>
               <p>Fifthly, For those Popish Opinions he tacks together, I must admonish him, that whensoever the Popes superiority began, 'tis certain out of Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> himself that his Supremacy and Infallibility was not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as an Article of Faith, no not at <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Ethelwolfs</hi> time, since he not only tells us <hi>This Nation was not subject to the Dominion of the Pope in Ecclesiastical causes for</hi> 1000 <hi>years after Christ, pag.</hi> 210. But also, <hi>that the very Papists for</hi> 1400 <hi>years, and all others, taught, that the Pope hath no infallible determining Power in Judging,</hi> pag 212. And this was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 500 years after our Charter. Again the same <hi>Perkins</hi> affirms Auricular confession did but begin about the year 800. <hi>But the first general Law to make this necessary to Salvation, was made in the</hi> Lateran <hi>Council under</hi> Innocent <hi>the Third, pag.</hi> 181. which was above 300 years after <hi>Ethelwolf</hi>'s Charter. Doubtless it was no Opinion received in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in <hi>Gratians</hi> time, <hi>Ann.</hi> 1150. for he declares it was disputed then, whether men should on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confess to God or to the Priest also? and saith he leaves it to the Reader to choose whether Opinion he please. Grat. <hi>de paen. dist.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 89. and the Gloss upon him tells us, that <hi>Gratian</hi> did indeed affirm this, but now (saith he) it is Heresie since the Church hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined it. <hi>ibid. distinct.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Lastly, As to the Invocation of Saints, it is not so Antient in Prayers as Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> thinks, for that story of <hi>Petrus Gnapheus</hi> mingling the Invocation of Saints with the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:200297:182"/> Prayers of the Church, and so making it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. <hi>Ann.</hi> 500. is a meer fable, and <hi>Perkins</hi> cites it out of <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> an Author which he censures to be full of Lies, pag. 43. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this <hi>Peter</hi> was an <hi>Eutychian</hi> Heretick, and unjustly intruded into the See of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and was hated by all Orthodox Christians, and particularly by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, of which he was no member; so that if he had set up this, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was not like to receive it from him. And again Mr. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> mistakes in saying <hi>Gregories</hi> Litany was made for the Invocation of Saints, for <hi>Bale</hi> (one bitter enough against Popery) charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es one of his successors for playing the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor in adding the Invocation of the deceased Saints to St. <hi>Gregories</hi> Litany. <hi>de vit. Pontif.</hi> pag. 65. And I did bring him good Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from Eye-witnesses, that our old <hi>Saxon</hi> Litanies yet extant (written above 100 years after <hi>Ethelwolf</hi>) have no Invocation of Saints in them. And <hi>Spelman</hi> proves there was no such Practice among them till about 1000 years after Christ. <hi>Tom.</hi> 1. pag. 218. and pag. 537. Bishop <hi>Ʋsher</hi> also proves that the Popish manner of praying to Saints was not used in the Church till the latter Ages. <hi>Answ. to the Jesuites Challenge, pag.</hi> 377. I choose to wave more Antient Authors in these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, not only for brevity sake, as this doth not directly belong to the main Question, but also in complyance with my Adversaries abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which may extend to search those mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Authors; wherein (if he be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious)
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:200297:183"/> he may receive abundant satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he hath mistaken exceedingly the true state of these Times when Tithes were given by <hi>Ethelwolf;</hi> wherein 'tis evident none of those Doctrines were the received Tenets of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which is not accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for the Opinions of private men; nor can the fancies of single Persons, not appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by that Church, nor imposed on its members to be believed, be properly called Popery.</p>
               <p n="21">§. 21. PAg 279. The instances of Holy Water, consecrating of Chrism, and Wax Tapers, standing up at the Gospel, and Sunday Processions, I passed by before, some of them being allowed by the best of Protestants; particularly that of standing up at the Gospel, being expresly commanded by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and was practised in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church within the first 400 years, and is prescribed by all the Antient Liturgies in the world; surely the Quaker cannot i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine we shall grant this to be Popery, meerly upon his word. Again the Chrism of the Primitive Church used at Baptism and Confirmation, was a very innocent sign of the Grace of the Spirit conveyed by those Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and was used soon after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles days, being mentioned in the oldest Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and strictly enjoyned by the Council of <hi>Laodicea, Ann.</hi> 365. But this did vastly differ from the Chrism of the modern
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:200297:183"/> Papists. And for the Processions which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gapetus</hi> is said to order on Sundaies; <hi>T. E.</hi> knows not that <hi>Processions</hi> are a usual name for <hi>Litanies,</hi> which Office used to be said walking in the Fields, in time of general Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, and that on any week-day, <hi>Mamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> used it. <hi>Ann.</hi> 460. But <hi>Agapetus</hi> ordered this Office should be said in the Church on Sundaies; and where lies the Popery of this? As for Holy-water, Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> will tell him, <hi>that the Consecration of it is not found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the first Fathers, but to believe this to be a remedy for Venial Sin, or that it hath power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Devils by the very using it, is a fiction unknown to the Antients.</hi> Dem. Probl. pag. 240. He also tells us there, that the Benediction of Candles is not found among the Primitive Fathers. And the Quaker cannot prove that among the <hi>Saxons</hi> any such blessing of Tapers were used; or if he could, it would amount to no more than a foolish superstition; so that still he hath found nothing that could denominate our Tithe-givers Papists.</p>

The Quaker next charges that Age with a piece of Popery not only believed, but wickedly put in Practice, by all his own Friends who were active in the late Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, <hi>viz. the deposing of Kings;</hi> which if the Popes had done in that Age, it had been no other than the Factions did in this Age. But <hi>T. E.</hi> cannot prove that any King had been deposed then by the Popes Authority. The History of <hi>Childerics</hi> deposition is falsly
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:200297:184"/> related by some flatterers of the Popes, as if it had been done by his Authority, as well as the setting up of <hi>Pepin</hi> in his stead, and the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving the <hi>French</hi> from their Oaths of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance; when indeed the Pope was only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised with as a Casuist, either before the Deed was done (as some Historians say) or afterwards to colour over the matter (as others). Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> confesses that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the Nobles and the People, and to this agree not only <hi>Sabellicus</hi> and <hi>Blondus</hi> ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him, but also <hi>Antoninus,</hi> who saith it was done <hi>by the common consent of all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Hist. p. 2.

'Tis true they all mention the Popes being advised with in this matter, but the reason of that was, <hi>because there was yet no Ʋ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversity at Paris, and few Learned men in</hi> France; <hi>and so they had recourse to the Pope, who deposed him not Authoritatively, but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting that he might be deposed.</hi> Almain <hi>de po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test.

But <hi>Hincma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> his Epistle (if <hi>T.E.</hi> had read it all) is alone sufficient evidence, that no People before <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelwolfs</hi> time, had exercised the power of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the Kings of <hi>France;</hi> for he shews they had never so much as excommunicated them, much less pretended to dispose of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; and yet if Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> had done it
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:200297:185"/> by his Legate <hi>Boniface</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> contrary to all late Authors affirms) he had done it himself, for <hi>Legatus cujusque est quasi Quisque.</hi> Besides I cited before three Authors who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly say, that <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh about 200 years after <hi>Ethelwolf,</hi> was the first who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to depose Kings and Emperours; see my 127. page, and if so, how could <hi>Zachary</hi> do it so long before? <hi>Otto Frisingensis</hi> saith, <hi>He had read over and over the Histories of the</hi> Roman <hi>Princes and Popes, and never found any before this</hi> Henry (<hi>whom</hi> Gregory <hi>the Seventh deposed,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>Excommunicated or deprived of his Kingdom by the Pope.</hi> Chron. <hi>l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 35. <hi>Before this Emperour (saith</hi> Godfry <hi>of</hi> Viter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium) <hi>we do not read of any one Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or deprived of his Empire by the Pope,</hi> Chron, <hi>p.</hi> 17.

And <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventinus</hi> saith, this Deposition of <hi>Henry</hi> was generally said to be <hi>a wickedness never heard of before.</hi> Annal. <hi>Bojor.</hi> l. 5. But because he hath Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> beside him, he may find there some of these Quotations, and also these following particulars proved very fully, <hi>viz.</hi> First, <hi>That the Popes were subject to the Emperor for</hi> 850. <hi>years at least,</hi> Perk. <hi>Dem. Probl. pag.</hi> 219. Secondly, <hi>That the Pope did not Depose Princes, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly not the</hi> Roman <hi>Emperor, till above</hi> 1000 <hi>years after</hi> Christ, <hi>id. ibid. pag.</hi> 220. <hi>and accordingly that</hi> Childeric <hi>was not Deposed by the Pope, nor did the</hi> French <hi>Kings derive their power from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Authority.</hi> pag. 222. 223. Thirdly, <hi>That
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:200297:185"/> the power of Deposing Princes was first established by</hi> Innocent <hi>the Third in the Council of</hi> Lateran. Ann. 1215. <hi>ib. pag.</hi> 224. And now is not this Quaker a man of a Brazen Brow, and a seared Conscience, who can Quote <hi>Perkins</hi> as one of his Witnesses for the Deposing of Kings and Emperors in the time of <hi>Ethelwolf;</hi> when he expresly Disputes for the contrary Opinion? However by this we may see al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so how little truth there is in that Fable of the Popes deposing the Emperor <hi>Leo Isaurus An.</hi> 731. for if <hi>Henry</hi> were the first Emperor thus used, above 300 years after, (as those fore-quoted Historians inform us) and if (as Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> affims) the Popes were subject to the Emperors at least 850 years, and never had Deposed any till above 1000 years after Christ; then this must needs be a Fable of his Deposing <hi>Leo, Ann.</hi> 731. And <hi>T. E</hi>'s. Authors, <hi>i. e. Platina, Steuchus</hi> and <hi>Werne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> were all of them very Partial for the Popes Supremacy, and so mis-represent the story, as may appear in that, whereas <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi> saith <hi>Gregory</hi> the Third Deprived <hi>Leo</hi> of his Empire as soon as he came to the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doom; 'tis certain, the same <hi>Gregory</hi> the Third owns <hi>Leo</hi> to be Emperor in the last year but one of his Life and Reign, for the said <hi>Gregory</hi> dates one of his Epistles thus, <hi>In the</hi> 23 <hi>year of the Reign of the most Pious Lord</hi> Leo Augustus. <hi>Greg.</hi> 3.

<pb n="322" facs="tcp:200297:186"/> before his Death; therefore doubtless he did not Depose that Emperor whom he owns for Emperor in his own Decretal Epistles. So that I hope neither <hi>T. E.</hi> nor <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and his Jesuites (who also labour much to make this Point of Popery seem Antienter than it is) shall ever be able to make out, <hi>That the Popes Power of Deposing Kings was held in the Age of</hi> Ethelwolf, <hi>or had ever been put in pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice.</hi> And I observe, though I Challenged him to shew that it was believed or practiced in this Nation about that Age, where and when this Charter was made, <hi>T. E.</hi> never attempts it, I conclude therefore that this point of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was not then received any where, nor particularly among the <hi>Saxons</hi> who gave Tithes.</p>

The next instance of Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Images, I did so fully clear the <hi>Saxons</hi> of <hi>Ethelwolf</hi>'s time from, in my former Book, by the Testimonies of the best Authors An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and Modern, pag. 129. 130. that <hi>T.

As may appear, in that it cannot be imagined he should mean that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church allowed the Worship of Images, <hi>An.</hi> 600. since he (in the very next words) saith; <hi>That</hi> Gregory <hi>(who was the Pope) denies that Images are to be Worshipped.</hi> lib. 9.

                  <hi>indict.</hi> 4. Ep. 9. and that <hi>the Councils after this time appoved of their being put in Churches, but did not teach they were to be Worshipped. And also that this Worship was first publickly establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> Ann. 788. <hi>in the second Council at</hi> Nice. But withall <hi>Perkins</hi> confesses, that the Synod of <hi>Francfort,</hi> (in which <hi>Charles</hi> the Great and the Popes Legates were present) <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned this</hi> Nicene <hi>Council as Heretical, and he relates that the Pope did so also.</hi> Ann. 794. and then sets down at large out of <hi>Hoveden</hi> (as I had done) the account of our <hi>Saxon</hi> Princes and Bishops, condemning this Worship of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages. <hi>Ann.</hi> 792. And yet this is <hi>T. E</hi>'s. Witness that Image-Worship began publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Ann.</hi> 600. Whereas he utterly confutes both <hi>T. E.</hi> and his Authors, who teach him that these Popes? <hi>Gregory</hi> the Second and Third, <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Stephen,</hi> were estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishers of the Worship of Images from about the year 730 to 750, for we see long after that, <hi>viz.</hi> 788, the Pope and his Legates condemned the Worshiping Images, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed those Popes, <hi>Gregory</hi> the Second, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> condemned the defacing and breaking Images (which were then used for Ornament and History only) but did by no means like the Worshiping them, and thence it was that the Council of <hi>Francfurt</hi> (as <hi>Perkins also</hi> notes) condemned both the Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> for decreeing they should be defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; and that of <hi>Nice</hi> which appointed they should be worshipped. So that <hi>Rome</hi> it self was Orthodox in this point by Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi>
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:200297:187"/> own confession, within 60 years of <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wolfs</hi> Donation; to which if the Reader will add what is said in the places Quoted in my former Book out of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> and Sir <hi>Roger Twisden,</hi> he may be fully convinced that the <hi>Gallican</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Churches (the most famous for the solemn settlement of Tithes) remained long after <hi>Ethelwolf</hi>'s time free from the Idolatry of Worshiping Images; of which <hi>T.E.</hi> slanderously accused them. To which let me only add, that his great and Learned Bishop <hi>Agobardus</hi> about the year 900, writ a vehement Book against the peoples superstition in Worshiping Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; wherein among divers forcible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against this practice, I find, he saith, <hi>He can prove out of the</hi> Roman <hi>Churches Mass-book that to condemn Image-worship, is the true Religion, the Catholick Custom, and the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Doctrine of the Fathers.</hi> Agobar. <hi>de Imagin.</hi> §. 30. pag. 263. And I am sure he can find no Authentick Canon of this Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for Worshipping Images till above 1000 years after Christ; so that the <hi>Saxons</hi> who gave Tithes were clear of this piece of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 287. As for <hi>Miracles,</hi> I had affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the belief of them did not make men Papists, and supposed <hi>T.E.</hi> and his Quakers durst not say it did, because they believe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate teaching, which is a far greater Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle than any in <hi>Bede;</hi> this he calls a Quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but 'tis <hi>Argumentum ad hominem,</hi> and such
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:200297:187"/> an one as he hath nothing to say against yet I did not by this evade a more direct proof of my Assertion; for I shewed that many Miracles are Recorded in <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and the oldest and best Church Histories, which do not prove the Authors or People of that Age Popish. And though he hath weeded <hi>Bede</hi>'s History for superstitious Miracles, yet I can prove there are divers Miracles in that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, wrought to convert Pagans and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Christian Faith, see <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 18. 19. <hi>ibid.

Nor is it unlikely that many such might be wrought by those who converted the <hi>Saxons</hi> from Heathenism; and if <hi>Bede</hi> were too cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous in reporting only what he had by hearsay, (for he confesses of many things in his History that he was informed of them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by fame, <hi>Praef. ad Histor.</hi>) and so report some false Miracles, that cannot brand him or his Age either with Popery. And I note also that the Miracles mentioned. <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. were not to confirm any Worship to <hi>Christ</hi>'s Cross, nor indeed the Worship of any other Cross; for there is not one word of Worshiping that Cross he speaks of, which was no other than an ordinary Cross of Wood stuck down for a Standard by <hi>Oswold,</hi> (who was no Popish Saint) in a Fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Pagans, and to do Honour to the Faith of a Crucified Saviour before Infidels, whereupon God gave him a great Victory over them, and caused Wonders to be
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:200297:188"/> wrought by that Cross, (as <hi>Bede</hi> saith) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. And no doubt there were many and great Miracles wrought by the Cross in the Primitive times, yet they gave all the Glory to him that suffered on it; and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed those Wonders, not so much by the sign, as by Prayer to God, which was innocent and no Popery, as <hi>Perkins</hi> will teach the Quaker. <hi>Dem. Problem.</hi> pag. 84. and 85. and for the rest of his Instances they are not worth the answering, being at the most but Testimonies, that the <hi>Saxons</hi> did incline to some Superstitions, which I never denied; but for that which is properly called Popery, and makes the seperation between them and the Protestants, from that (as I have proved) they were clear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 290. Concerning the <hi>Intercession of Saints</hi> I have already spoken (upon his 277 page) and shewed from good Authority, that <hi>T E.</hi> and his guides too are mistaken if they charge it on the <hi>Saxon</hi> Church; especially so early as <hi>Ethelwolf</hi>'s time; and the Quaker doth but repeat his former bafled Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and tell over again his once confuted falshoods, as that of <hi>Gnaphaeus</hi> mixing the Saints names with the publick Prayers of the Church (which he falsly and ignorantly now says is spoken of the Church in general) and that of the Names of Saints being in <hi>Gregories</hi> Litany; and that notorious Fable of all the Archbishops being Forreigners for 150 years. So that I have nothing to add here but my
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:200297:188"/> Admiration at his Impudence, who can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blushing tire his Reader with the repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such stuff. Only let me tell him, Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> his instances do only concern Foreign Churches; but I brought divers proofs that the <hi>Saxons</hi> (of whom we now dispute) did not invocate the Saints, which as yet remain unanswered; only by a new passage out of <hi>Bede</hi>'s History, miserably wrested, he attempts to prove the <hi>Saxons</hi> did believe they interceded with God for them, because one <hi>Ceolfride</hi> mentions it as the desire of <hi>Adamnanus, that he might have</hi> Peter <hi>his Patron with God,</hi> L. 5. c. 22; which may be candidly expounded, upon the account of those general Prayers which the Scripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates, <hi>Revel.</hi> vi. 10. and the Fathers belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the Saints made to God for all true Christians. Or else when the Saints shall judge the World at the Last day, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> should own them who had followed his Rites, before the great Judge. But 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident it ought not to be translated [Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator] because there is not one Prayer in <hi>Bede</hi> to St. <hi>Peter</hi> or any other Saint, and <hi>Bede</hi> himself in the end of this History prays on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Christ, without the mention of any other Saint or Mediator. So that still we see the <hi>Saxons</hi> appear clear from this point of Popery also, till after they had given Tithes. The Article of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation he hath yielded before, and I had here established it with two new proofs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 100 years later than <hi>Ethelwolf,</hi> to which
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:200297:189"/> his silence gives consent; only he pretends there are some other things for which <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi> charges the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>viz.</hi> the Worshiping Water, Salt, Oyl, and other consecrated things. To which I reply, this Charge is not often urged, nor very easie to be proved concerning the present Papists, that they give Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to these; but however it can never be shewed that our Tithe-giving <hi>Saxons</hi> had any such Opinion or Practice, and therefore they were no Idolaters, and <hi>T.E.</hi> is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest slanderer of his and our Forefathers.</p>
               <p n="22">§. 22. PAg. 294. The Quaker thinks <hi>Bede</hi>'s Relation, as a Historian, is so good Evidence <hi>of the Judgment of the</hi> Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Church in point of intercession of Saints,</hi> pag. 292. that from a meer ambiguous Word, he confidently thinks to prove it, yet like an unjust measurer, when I quote <hi>Bede</hi> professed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly writing as a Divine upon the point of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and declaring utterly against obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Salvation by them; as also <hi>Alcuinus</hi> in the same Manner, <hi>T. E.</hi> calls these proofs the Judgment of these particular men, and will not allow them sufficient to prove the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral received Opinion of these times; is not this to use false Ballances, to buy by one weight and sell by another? I am sure there is no Merit in such Injustice. But the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Reader will believe these two who were the most famous <hi>Saxon</hi> Divines of their times, are better evidence for the Opinions of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification by Gods Mercy and Christ's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:200297:189"/> than any <hi>T.

E.</hi> brings out of him, are above 100 years after <hi>Ethelwolf</hi>'s time; and 'tis no news for Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake in his dates of Popish Opinions. But I have before cleared those expressions of their Charters from the modern Popish Sense of those Phrases, and proved by <hi>Anselm, Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> and Bishop <hi>Ʋsher,</hi> &amp;c. That <hi>Merit</hi> in the Sense of the present <hi>Roman</hi> Church was not believed in that Age nor long after, and Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> himself I have produced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Quaker of this. Finally, the matter of their excluding the Apocrypha from the Canon of the Scripture <hi>T. E.</hi> yields a second time, and clears the <hi>Saxons</hi> from Popery in that point; but then pretends, that alone will not prove them no Papists; very true, but that is not the only Point he hath yielded himself, for he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses they were clear of the Half-Communion, Seven Sacraments, Transubstantiation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I have now abundantly proved that the <hi>Saxons</hi> were no Papists in any of the great points which Protestants now deny; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing subject to the Pope nor Members of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, not holding the Popes Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy or Infallibility, the necessity of Priests abstaining from Marriage, Purgatory, Prayers to Saints, Merit of good Works, Worshipping of Images, the Popes power to Depose Kings, Absolve their Subjects

The Church of <hi>England</hi> was then as it is now, a distinct Church of it self, under its own Prince and Patriarch, its King was supreme in all Causes, and over all Persons; its Priests had liberty to marry, its Canon of Scripture was intire, its Worship free from Prayers to Saints, from Adoration of Images, or of the Sacramental bread, and from all other formal Idolatry. Its Sacraments were but Two, and the Communion Administred in both kinds, and received without the monstrous conceit of Transubstantiation. Its People were not frighted with Purgatory, cheated with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, nor enslaved by Auricular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. They did not own the Popes Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Supremacy, nor rely on him as an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Judge, they believed not his power to Depose Kings or to Absolve their Subjects from their Allegiance. And finally their hopes of Heaven rested not upon the Merits of their own good Works, but upon the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God and the Merits of Jesus Christ. Wherefore doubtless I had good reason to affirm they were neither Papists nor Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that they differed from the present Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in all the most material Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith, in dispute between them and us; being generally nearer to the Protestant Church of <hi>England</hi> in their Opinions, than to the modern Papists. So that without taking any notice of his frivilous Questions and nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seous
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:200297:190"/> Repetitions of that which hath been so often disproved; I conclude, that the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker hath slandred the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and that he shews both Ignorance and Impudence, in supposing the Church was so corrupted with Popery then, that their Donation of Tithes ought not to stand good, or be enjoyed, no not by a Protestant Ministry,</p>

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 301. But still <hi>T. E.</hi> cannot give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver harping on this one string of Popery, and without any occasion, runs on to rail at the Popery of those times for 4 or 5 Pages toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, shewing all along (as the Reader may discern by what hath been said,) his Malice, Ignorance and Dishonesty; to all which I shall not need to say much. But let him read Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> honestly, and he will find very few Corruptions in <hi>Rome</hi> its self, in Pope <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> time, when <hi>Augustine</hi> came hither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the year 600, and that it is no wonder if the <hi>English-Saxons</hi> (who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Christian Faith from <hi>Gregory</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Church) were very respectful to him, and had a great Opinion of it; and since this Country was then so Barbarous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of Learned Men, it was not strange they frequently sent thither for advise in their Doubts where there was great plenty of Learned Men. And since no Church in that Age had a certain or better attested successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Apostles than that of <hi>Rome,</hi> for that reason as well as because their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters came thence, divers of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Arch-Bishops
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:200297:191"/> went thither for Consecration; and for the use of the Latin Tongue in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> out of good Authors as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures us, that of the Five Languages then u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in this Island, <hi>Latin</hi> was the only Tongue generally understood by all. <hi>Dem. Problem.</hi> p. 153. Nor was it any disparagement to the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi> of those times, to learn to sing from <hi>Rome,</hi> so lately the the Seat of the Empire, and the most famous City for Arts and Sciences in the Western World. It is true indeed, divers of the Bishops of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, about an Age or two after <hi>Gregory,</hi> were Evil Men; but others of them were very Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their way. 'Tis true <hi>T. E</hi>'s. own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <hi>Wernerus</hi> confesseth of Pope <hi>Constantine, that he was the fifth infamous Pope among so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as had hitherto sat; the Spirit of God did so keep that Holy Apostolick Seat in Vertue and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi> Which Sentence our Quaker cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leaves out, and makes that which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor meant for the Honour of <hi>Rome,</hi> to sound to its dispraise. And truly 5 bad Bishops among 96 was no great number. When <hi>T. E.</hi> hath leisure, let him look over that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Character of <hi>John</hi> the Sixth, <hi>Constantine</hi> the First, <hi>Gregory</hi> the Second, and Third, Pope <hi>Zachary,</hi> and <hi>Stephen</hi> the Second, <hi>Paul</hi> the First, <hi>Adrian</hi> the First, <hi>Leo</hi> the Third, <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius</hi> the Third, <hi>Leo</hi> the Fourth, <hi>Benedict</hi> the Third, and <hi>Nicolas</hi> the First, who were both before and after Pope <hi>Joan;</hi> and he shall find High Encomiums of their Sanctity. But it seems <hi>T.E.</hi> was sore put to it for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:200297:191"/> to rail at the Tithe-giving Age, since he is forced to tell a monstrous Lie, and put the vilest abuse in the world upon poor <hi>Platina,</hi> bringing in those words which he spake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the year 1471. of the corruptions in the Church then; and falsly saying they were spoken of the Times before <hi>Ethelwolf.</hi> Vid. <hi>Plat.</hi> Vit. <hi>Steph.</hi> 3. pag. 118. And again in Quoting <hi>Wernerus</hi> he leaves out a Line which would quite have spoiled his Cause had he put it in, for he brings in that Author ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming against the times after <hi>Ethelwolf,</hi> and the scandals that then happened in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church, <hi>Which</hi> (saith he) <hi>O Lord hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto thou hast kept with so much care.</hi> This <hi>T.E.</hi> left out, because it implied that God had kept the <hi>Roman</hi> Church from these scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals till after <hi>Ethelwolf</hi>'s time. 'Tis a sign he grows empty of just matter, when he is come to make shuffling and Lying his last refuge; for my Part I do not need nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to vindicate the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, nor the <hi>Saxons</hi> neither, further than Truth will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; for if both had been corrupted in other things, yet they held a Primitive Opinion in point of Tithes, and however the giving of them was no Popery.</p>
               <p n="23">
                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:200297:192"/>§. 23. PAg. 307. It further proves Tithes no Popery, since (as they were given before Popery came in) so they were retained, received, allowed and confirmed after Popery was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, even by those very Martyrs who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Protestant Faith, <hi>Cranmer, Hooper, Ridley, Latimer, Taylor</hi> and <hi>Bradford.</hi> All Learned and Eminent Divines. To this the sum of <hi>T.E</hi>'s. tedious reply is, that these Mens receiving Tithes will not make them less Popish, because they lived but in the dawning of the Reformation, and all Truths were not discovered at once, but gradually. And that is is not fair to argue there were no other Evils in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but what they (at that early hour) testified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, especially since divers things which they took no notice of, were plainly condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by others, and Tithes particularly by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Godly Martyrs, <hi>Thorp, Swinderby, Brute, Wickliffe,</hi> &amp;c. This <hi>T. E.</hi> calls a plain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, and indeed so it is of his folly to urge it, and his confidence to repeat it. For the reason which he gives why <hi>Cranmer</hi> and his Contemporaries could not discover the true nature of Tithes, <hi>viz.</hi> Their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at the dawning and day-break of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, holds far more strongly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade us that <hi>Thorp</hi> and his Contemporaries could not discover their true Nature, for these lived before the day-break at all, in
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:200297:192"/> the very midnight of Popery. And if Truths be discovered gradually, then the latter Martyrs should have more knowledge, and discover more Truths than the former, for it is a Preposterous thing to fancy God should Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal Truths gradually, and yet give more light to the preceding Age than that which followed, and therefore 'tis absurd to believe God should reveal a Truth to <hi>Thorp, Brute,</hi> &amp;c. and in his progress of making more discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, hide it again from those of the Age following, <hi>viz. Cranmer, Ridley,</hi> &amp;c. who had Ten times more knowledge than any of the opposers of Tithes had, and far better Light, and yet, though they well knew such a Doctrine (as condemning Tithes) had been taught by some before them, they did reject it as an Error; and surely we ought where such difference is, to follow them that had the greater Light, and were better able by far to discern Truth from Falshood. <hi>Wickliffe</hi> and his Company in the night of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance took some Bushes for Bears, and Tithes for Popery; but when the day was broke, <hi>Cranmer</hi> and his Company saw the Bushes were truly Bushes, and Tithes agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Scripture and Primitive Practice; surely therefore these latter are to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the former to be rejected in this point, though they were in the right in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. I am sure <hi>Cranmer, Ridly,</hi> &amp;c. are extreamly wronged by any who think that <hi>Thorp, Brute,</hi> &amp;c. had more knowledg than they; for though <hi>Wickliffe</hi> was a good Schollar,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:200297:193"/> after the rate of the Age he lived in, yet he was far short of the meanest of the other Sx; and for the other Three, <hi>Thorp, Brute</hi> and <hi>Swinderby,</hi> they were men (as far as I see) destitute of all solid knowledge: So that I wonder Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> should so far disparage the Spirit of God, as to tell us of <hi>Brutes</hi> and <hi>Thorps</hi> Discourses manifesting the mighty O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of Gods Spirit, and the marvelous force and strength of the Lords Might, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for truly in some part of their Discourses there is not Common Sense, as I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of <hi>Brute</hi> frequently, and one Instance of <hi>Thorp</hi> I gave before, Pag. 139. where he cites a silly saying, of his own, as some of the Fathers Words, and <hi>T. E.</hi> even where he would vindicate him, cannot tell that ever any Father said so, and I am sure no Father ever did; did the Spirit help him to tell that Lie? But tis not my Sense only that these men did weakly oppose Tithes, for <hi>T. E</hi>'s admired Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> accounts these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (that Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> fancied Inspired) to be so despicable and mean, that we see he scorned to stuff his Book with them, telling us that, for the Arguments of <hi>Wickliffe, Brute, Thorp,</hi> and some such, he had rather send the Reader to <hi>Fox</hi> for them, <hi>than stuff that place with them.</hi> Chap. 7. pag. 167. Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is to be commended for his industry, but his judgment often fails him, as we have on several occasions shewed, and therefore the Reader will the less wonder to find him sometimes speaking against Primitive Rites
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:200297:193"/> and Practices as Popish and Superstitious. But I shall let him rest, and conclude that to me it is a plain Demonstration, that <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> knew all the Truths that <hi>Thorp</hi> and his Company knew, and many more, and that if men of less knowledge took an Opinion to be true, which men of more knowledge condemned as false; every wary man should follow the bigger and better Light. And for <hi>T. E</hi>'s mistake in calling them Martyrs, of whose constancy to the end, and of whose manner of Dying there is nothing but Mr. <hi>Foxe</hi>'s May-be's and suppositions, I shall pass it as nothing to the purpose, it being suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to me that <hi>T. E.</hi> grants the most famous Protestant Divines, who carryed on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and certainly opposed Popery with their Lives, both allowed and received Tithes, not accounting them either Popish or unlawful. And this shall suffice for this Fourth Chapter.</p>

               <p n="1">§. 1. PAg. 327. Having proved the <hi>Divine Institution,</hi> the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Practice and voluntary Donation of Tithes, and cleared them all from the Exceptions of my Adversary, I am now to declare the <hi>Positive Laws</hi> for them, in order to make good the Clergys Civil Right to this sort of Maintenance. And the preceding Donation was a very proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to this Point, for our old Sages of the Law tell us, <hi>That a Civil Right is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by Donation.</hi> Fleta, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 2. §. 17. Bracton <hi>de acqu. rer.

And even they who had no manner of Civil Right to a thing before, do often acquire a Civil Right to it by either of these waies; let them prove a good Donation, or but a long Possession, and the Laws do confirm that Right. Now our Law-givers found the Clergy endowed with Tithes by a pious pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and firm Donation, and in actual posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:200297:194"/> of them, and since the end of Laws, and the Duty of Law-givers, is to secure every man in his just rights; our Ancient Kings (such as <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessour) did alwaies take the first care of the Rights of the Church, looking upon it as one of the chiefest parts of their Office to preserve and maintain the Church as that good King speaks in the Sentence cited before out of his Laws. <hi>Leg.</hi> Edw. <hi>Confess. cap.</hi> 15. and when he or they made any Laws, <hi>They began</hi> (saith <hi>Hoveden) with those for the Church, because by it both King and Kingdom have their solid Foundation.</hi> Hoved. <hi>Annal. pars post. p.</hi> 343. Many of which Laws made by our Kings and their great Councils, I cited in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 97, 98. and the abridgment of them all is that first Branch of <hi>Magna Charta, That the Church of</hi> England <hi>shall have all her Rights and Liberties inviolable:</hi> a Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so Sacred that it is declared in our Laws, <hi>That any Statute made contrary to this, shall be void,</hi> 42 Ed. 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. Wherefore our Princes and Parliaments of the Ages before the Reformation, and since also, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to these Constitutions of their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, have made divers Laws to confirm Tithes to the Clergy, so that now they are secured in the enjoyment of them by as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and as firm Laws as do secure the Laiety in their Estates, and therefore doubtless they have a Civil Right to Tithes. <hi>T.E.</hi> hath nothing to object here, but to catch at a Phrase, and tell us, That <hi>if the Reformers
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:200297:195"/> settled Tithes upon the Clergy, according to the Constitutions of their Fore-fathers, then they are Popish in their settlement, for their Predecessors were professed Papists; and consequently the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions made under them for the Maintenance of the Church were absolutely Popish.</hi> But I was not speaking of Laws since the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation only, my discourse concerns all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Laws for Tithes, made at any time since the Donation, and who sees not the shallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this fallacy, that because some of our Law-makers were professed Papists, therefore the settlements they made were Popish, as if all actions of Papists were Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish; or as if <hi>Magna Charta</hi> were no creditable claim, because it was made by Papists pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest? And supposing the confirmers of the settlement of Tithes were all professed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, yet in this Act they only confirmed what the Laws of God (expounded by Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive opinion and practice) had declared to be due. They fixed the Clergy in the enjoyment of that which they found freely given to them and actually in their possession, and since Protestant Princes, who rejected those Constitutions of their Fore-fathers that were Popish, have ever since confirmed, approved, and continued those for Tithes, 'tis manifest they did not think these Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions Popish; and surely all our Kings and Parliaments, since the Reformation, may be presumed to know what was Popish and what was not, at least as well as this Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and if either their judgment, or my
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:200297:195"/> former proofs, can out-weigh the bold As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions and weak reasonings of <hi>T. E.</hi> then the settlement of Tithes is not Popish, and this Objection comes to nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 328. Doubtless the readiest and fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est way for this <hi>remover of Positive Laws,</hi> to have disproved the Clergys Civil Right to Tithes, had been to have shewed that no Laws now in force do give the Clergy any such Right, and either that there never were such Laws, or that they are repealed. For the first enquiry was concerning matter of Fact, whether there were such Laws now in force or no, and by declining this way of proceeding, he tacitely grants that (for all his removing them) there are Positive Laws in force still; and if so, he must in the next place prove these Laws are so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, that they ought to be repealed, which if he were able to do (as I am sure he is not) yet I must tell him, that till the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority do actually repeal them, these Laws do give the Clergy a Civil Right to Tithes, and no subject of <hi>England</hi> may detain them or take them away, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that in his opinion the Laws for them are unjust: for at that rate the Law could settle nothing; there being no Civil Right, which some or other may not pretend to be unjustly settled in their judgment, and so every mans property shall be at the mercy of his Neighbours opinion, and every private man would be above the Law, <hi>For if thou
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:200297:196"/> judge the Law, thou art not a doer of the Law, but a judge,</hi> saith the Apostle <hi>James</hi> iv. 11. Suppose upon a Tryal for an Estate, the Law settle it upon one whom the Tenant in his private judgment, believes not to be the right owner, nevertheless this Person hath the Civil Right to this Estate, and the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant must pay his Rent to him whom the Law determines for, even against his own opinion. And those who hold the Laws for granting of Impropriations to Lay-men were not well grounded, or are not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Equity; yet while the Laws are in force, do not (as the Quakers do by the Clergy) deny to pay these Tithes to them: For Human Laws are the Arbiters of Civil Right, and <hi>[Right]</hi> in this sense is no more than a <hi>[Legal Tithe]</hi> which may sometimes vary from strict Equity, but of that Magistrates and not private men must judge. So that it had been a better way for <hi>T. E.</hi> to have removed the positive Laws and the Civil Right together, since although he and his Quakers may fancy he hath proved the Laws unjust, yet till Authority be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced they are so, the Civil Right will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main still; and if that perverse Sect (who will not permit Kings and Parliaments to set out Civil Rights) do suffer for detaining that which the Laws saies is anothers due, they <hi>suffer as evil doers,</hi> and transgressors of those Laws, which are the Hedge of every mans Property. He knows that the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Royalists did pay Tithes to those who
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:200297:196"/> had Law on their side, in the times of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion; and he shall here a great Protestant Divine tell him what the Reformed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians now do, in Popish Countries: <hi>By ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of those Laws</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Protestants do not deny to pay Tithes in those Kingdoms, where Princes by their Laws command them to be paid, and upon this ground our Divines have sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied those that pretended they scrupled to pay them to Popish Priests who Minister to Idolatry.</hi> Rivet. <hi>in</hi> Genes. <hi>Exerc.</hi> 80. Now if the Law would bind us to this payment suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it were not strictly agreeable to equity, how much more when it is grounded upon Scripture and Primitive Antiquity, upon reason and justice, upon Donation and Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesion, to break such Laws of men is to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress God's Law also: But <hi>T. E.</hi> despairs of proving that there are no Laws to settle Tithes, and therefore makes a feeble at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to cut the Clergy off from the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of them, by pretending that Lay-men have a better claim by Temporal Laws, than Clergy-men can have, because the ground of their claims are different; whereas indeed they both claim as Subjects, for in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Church, Clergy-men are Subjects as well as Lay-men: <hi>T. E.</hi> therefore (as my Friend rightly noted) must prove the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Out-laws before he can deprive them of the benefit of the Laws of their Country, which give unto men in all capacities Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Temporal, that which they judge to be their due; and since the Clergy (as
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:200297:197"/> his brother Priest hath proved) have a right to them by the Laws of God, as well as the Laws of the Land, their Title is still the stronger; for Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> will Teach him these two Rights do not enterfere with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. PAg. 331. But though nothing can be weaker than this Cavil of Lay-men, and Clergy-mens claiming in different capacities, yet <hi>T. E.</hi> spends above ten Pages on it, reiterating it in variety of words, that if it will not pierce by its force, it may by its continual dropping—<hi>Non vi sed saepe cadendo.</hi> But since that which relies on a falshood can never be strengthened by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of words, therefore that admonition doth well sute him, <hi>Aut deme verbis, aut adde viribus,</hi> and I must desire that we may either have more truth and reason; or fewer words; for all this <hi>Jargon</hi> is but to amuse his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers. And indeed, as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> observes, <hi>Nothing is easier than by a multitude of words to abuse a company of ignorant men, who most admire that which they least understand:</hi> But those who read his Discourse with Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may perceive that his whole force re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies upon this false and foolish Principle, <hi>That Human Laws cannot settle any thing upon men in Spiritual capacities, at least with respect to their Spiritual Function.</hi> Which absurd Position impeaches all the Legislators in Christendom (especially in the Protestant part of it) of Folly, for making Laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:200297:197"/> the Clergy; yea, it charges his Friends the <hi>Bohemians</hi> as deep as any, for settling Stipends on Ministers by Temporal Laws, and other States who have done the like; for according to <hi>T. E.</hi> their Ministers cannot claim these Stipends by those Laws, because their capacities and the Laws they claim by are of different natures; and according to him they were fools that made such Laws. I am sure all sound Protestants believe, the Clergy as well as the Laiety are subject to the King and Laws of the Land, and if they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend against them even in their Spiritual ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, they are as liable to punishment as any other Subjects, and there are divers Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Laws to direct them in their Spiritual capacity; and shall they despise these Laws, and say they are not binding to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these Laws and their capacities are of different Natures? How easily might <hi>T. E.</hi> at this rate argue his credulous Quakers into this gross Point of Popery, <hi>That the Clergy are exempt from all Subjection to Temporal Laws, and the Church must not be governed by the Laws of secular Princes?</hi> Which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> would prove by this very Argument, <hi>Because the Civil and Ecclesiastical Powers are different in their Nature, Acts, Offices, and Ends.</hi> Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm. <hi>de Rom.

<pb n="346" facs="tcp:200297:198"/> and a Free-gift to that Religious Office are by the Laws accounted as good Qualifications for a Civil Right, as Heirship, Purchase, Free-gift, or Civil Office, can be to a Lay-man; nor do we claim the Tithes of any particular Parish meerly as Ministers, but as our Institution and Induction makes us the true and lawful successors of those who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed those Rights before, and put us into possession of those Rights, which the Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Donation of the owners, ratified by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Laws, had settled upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbents there. And though when a Lay-man and a Clergy-man claim a Right, the Persons claiming are of different capacities, yet the same Human Laws having settled both these Rights, their claim it self relies on the same ground, for both claim that which the Law hath settled upon them: And since a Free-gift to one in his Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al capacity, is by the Laws of this Land as good a ground for a claim, as to one in a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil capacity; therefore the man in a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Capacity hath as good Civil Right to what is given him, as the man in a Civil Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity hath to what is given him; yea, if <hi>T. E.</hi> will suppose both Capacities to meet in one Person, as in a Clergy-man that were Lord Chancellor; and suppose the Law set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled some Rights upon his Ecclesiastical, and others upon his civil office, doubtless he would have as good civil right, and as fair a claim to that which belonged to his Spiritual, as to that which belong'd to his temporal office: And if
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:200297:198"/> the temporal estate settled on the Chancellor, were upon this condition, that he were also a Priest, then would he by vertue of his Spiritual qualification have a Civil Right to that estate: As for the making out our claim to Tithes by Divine Laws, we have done that in its proper place; but it is our Civil Right which we are proving here, and therefore here it suffices that we produce Human Laws, and shew that those Laws have settled the Rights of those in our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, as well and as firmly, as they have done the Rights of those in Civil Capacity, nor shall I be so foolish to obey the baffled Quaker who would willingly call me off from proving that which is the proper enquiry here, and set me on work upon that which I had done before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 334. I observed there were great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between Civil Capacities, some claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Heirship, as suppose <hi>T.E.</hi> others by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a Civil Office, as the Mayor of a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, yet one Law gives equal Civil Right to <hi>T.E.</hi> and to the Mayor, though they claim under different Qualifications: whence it follows that the difference of mens capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties doth not hinder them from having equal Rights by the Laws of the Land. Here the Quaker either through haste or design mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes me, as if I had said the Mayors of Corporations claim under different Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, to which I shall only say as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> to <hi>Cresconius, Read diligently first that
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:200297:199"/> which thou writest against, and either under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it, or do not pervert to another meaning that which thou dost not understand.</hi> As to the Argument, since a Civil Office gives as good a Right to that which is settled on that Office, as Heirship doth to an Inheritance, it follows that men in different Capacities may have equal Civil Right. And where the same Person hath divers Capacities, and by vertue of them Rights of divers kinds, yet the same Human Laws settle all those Rights: I instanced in the King, who, as our Law speaks, is a <hi>Mixt Person</hi> having both a Civil and Spiritual Capacity, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Rights belonging to him in each Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, a Catalogue of which <hi>T. E.</hi> (who is best fitted for <hi>English</hi> Authors) may find in <hi>The Present State of</hi> England, <hi>Par.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 85. where he may see that Human Laws do give the King a Civil Right to things claimed in his Spiritual Capacity, and his Highest Right of this kind, <hi>viz.</hi> his being Supreme Governour of the Church, was declared and settled by a Statute Law, which being no more than a Human Law, yet it settles a Right on the King in his Spiritual Capacity; and though I believe he had a higher Right to that Title and Power from God's Word, yet he hath now a Civil Right superadded by vertue of this Statute Law: and as good a Civil Right as <hi>T. E.</hi> hath to his Estate, yea a better, because there is a special Act of Parliament to confirm it, whence it is clear that Human Laws may add a Civil Right, to
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:200297:199"/> that which might have been claimed by God's Law before, and not hurt the first Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and that they can give as good Civil Right to Persons in a Spiritual Capacity, as to those in a Civil Capacity: and this is very much to the purpose, because it proves that which the absurd Quaker denyed, <hi>viz.</hi> That Human Laws can settle a Civil Right upon those in Spiritual Capacity. And if a Lay-man and a Clergy-man both claim their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rights, one by vertue of a Free-gift to his Place and Office, the other by vertue of a like Gift to his Name and Family; the Law will declare the Spiritual man hath as good a Civil Right as the Lay-man, nor will there be any thing required of one, more than of the other, to make out his claim: The one must prove his Spiritual Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the other his Civil Qualification; and then the Law which determines Civil Rights, will as readily declare the Priest's Right as the Lay-mans, and since our Priest-hood is as easie to prove as <hi>T. E</hi>'s descent, I Judge, our claim is as good as his; nor did I design any abuse to his Mother, unless he make it one, by wounding a whole Order of men, being willing to allow her honesty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on less proof than we are able to give of our being Priests or Ministers of Christ. But how strangely partial is this Quaker? he can Question without any regret, whether our Priest-hood be legitimate, and impudently saies, <hi>pag.</hi> 479, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that we are no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Gospel, whenas all the sober
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:200297:200"/> Protestants in <hi>England,</hi> and the whole world, know we are such, and own us as such, and the Laws of the Kingdom do declare us to be such; yet it must be a crime in me to say that our Ordination is easier to prove than his Mothers honesty, which could not be certainly known by any but her self: I thought our Spiritualized Quaker had not been so much concerned for his Mother ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Flesh—<hi>Tantaené animis cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestibus irae!</hi> As to the main Controversie, if Spiritual mens claims to that which belongs to them as such, were not cognizable by the Civil Magistrate, then must there be a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Independent Ecclesiastical Tribunal set up, at which alone Spiritual Persons, and their Causes must be tried without appeal: and indeed this is the natural consequence of what <hi>T. E.</hi> hints about a Spiritual claim be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not under the cognizance of Human Laws, because they are not of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with it: But neither he nor his Prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter the Jesuites shall make us desire any such Exemption, we find that the Laws of our Country do not look at the difference of mens Capacities but the equity of their Title, and if a Clergy-man Sue for Land due to his Church, against a Lay-man who detains it upon pretence of Heirship, Purchase, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though the persons claiming be of different capacities, yet if the Clergy-man have the better Evidence, the Law will declare the Civil Right to that Land is in him, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree him the possession of it. All which
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:200297:200"/> abundantly shews that all Subjects, whether they be of Spiritual or Civil Capacity, have their Rights settled and secured by Law; that the Clergy have as firm a Civil Right to their Tithes by Human Laws, as the Laiety to their Estates: though the persons claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing differ in their Qualification, the Law gives, <hi>Suum cuique:</hi> To every man in every Qualification, that which belongs to him.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. PAg. 339. I should tire the Reader and become like unto my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, if I followed him in all his imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent follies; nevertheless that he may not be wise in his own conceit, I shall briefly tell him by way of reply to this whole enquiry; That our Laws and Law-givers do not think the Laiety and the Clergy to be of such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary capacitys, but that they both agree in the common Capacity of Subjects, nor do any (but he and the Jesuites) say that the Spiritual Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity makes a man of so contrary a nature to Human Laws, that they cannot settle and secure his Rights, exact his obedience, and punish his disobedience. The Clergy (with us) are one of the Three Estates, <hi>Present State of</hi> England, <hi>pag.</hi> 231. and are govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and protected by Human Laws, as well as the Laiety: surely he was dreaming of some Quaking Speaker who hath given himself a pretended Spiritual Capacity, and he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may justly be said to be opposite to the Laws of the Land, and his claims of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:200297:201"/> nature, because he bids defiance to them, and will do what he doth in despite of them; but the regular Protestant Clergy are as obedient to the Law as any other Subjects, they are more the Ministers of Christ than the Laiety, but not less under subjection than they. They were born Subjects, and their new Character of Spiritual Capacity doth not exempt them from being Members of the Common-wealth, and all that are such (whatever their Capacities be) are taken care for by the Laws of the Common-wealth, without making any alteration in their Capacities; so that if an Estate should pass through the hands of persons of all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, and at last be legally settled on the Church of <hi>[A]</hi> doubtless the Law would be as ready to declare that the Rector of that Church in his Spiritual capacity, had as firm a Civil Right to that Estate, as any of those in Civil capacities who enjoyed it before, for the Law only takes notice of the equity of mens claims, not of the difference of their capacities. I know a Church on which 30 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> was lately settled out of certain Lands, by the gift of the deceased Owner of those Lands; and how ridiculous would it be for the present Owner or Occupant of those Lands detaining this 30 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> to plead, that the Minister of that Church was a person in a Spiritual capacity, and so without changing his capacity, could have no benefit by the Temporal Laws; and if the detainer should add, that the Laws gave
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:200297:201"/> Civil Right only to men in Civil capacity, and therefore unless that Minister would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge himself no more a Minister than a Lay-man, he could not expect that those Laws which asserted Lay-mens Civil Rights, should assert his Civil Right to this Estate? Would not this be hissed out of any Court of Justice? Yet this is the Stuff the Quakers applaud.</p>

The four next Pages of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Book noted his absurd mistake of the Tenure of a <hi>Lay-fee,</hi> and gave reasons why the Temporal Right was added to the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and why the Clergy are called <hi>Spiritual Persons,</hi> and withal taxed his disingenuous concealing my Friends Arguments: All this he passes by, under the covering of this false pretence, that it was railing and not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning; but indeed because the Accusations were too just, and the Reasons too firm to be denied or evaded: So that I will only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish him, that the very Statute he cites in his first Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 333. gives one good reason why it was needful to add the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Right to the Spiritual, <hi>viz. Because di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers evil disposed persons, &amp;c. having no respect to their duty to Almighty God, against Right and Conscience did subtract their Tithes:</hi> viz. To restrain such evil disposed persons as our Quakers now are, who value not God's Laws,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:200297:202"/> nor will act according to Right and a good Conscience, unless it be for fear of Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral punishments; and when Religion will not make men just, there the Magistrate must by Temporal Laws take care that God's Laws be observed, and punish those that break them. But as to the matter of Fact, <hi>(viz. That Kings and Princes have given the Clergy a Civil Right to Tithes) T. E.</hi> is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to suppose it, (because 'tis too plain to be denied) only he will examine them by what Power they did this, since Christ had set out another maintenance for his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, <hi>Luke</hi> x. 7, 8. and <hi>Matth.</hi> x. 11. <hi>viz. Meat and Drink.</hi> This Objection I did suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently answer before, shewing, it was a particular Mission, and a peculiar case<note n="‖" place="margin">Quae prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepta sunt, non debent in Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi. <hi>Reg.

                  </note>, and that provision was no more intended for a perpetual rule, than the annexed directions about Coats and Staves. And whereas <hi>T.E.</hi> objects, <hi>That Christ made no new provision for their maintenance in the second Mission, and therefore intended the first should stand:</hi> I might as well argue he made none about Coats and Staves neither, and so that would stand too. But we have shewed Christ did ordain, that his Ministers should live of that which was given them in requital for the good News of the Gospel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. 14. and more than bare Meat and Drink; yea, Tithes and Lands were given them on this account, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by their Master's order they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and enjoy them; yea, Christ command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Believers to give them a part of all their
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:200297:202"/> goods, <hi>Galat.</hi> vi. 6. and they did obey that Precept, who gave them a Tenth part of all: wherefore Kings and Princes, in giving and settling Tithes, did act according to Christ's mind declared by St. <hi>Paul;</hi> and the very same Apostle had told them, the larger part of their goods they gave, the greater reward they should receive, <hi>Galat.</hi> vi. 7, 8. So that they having more good things for themselves than bare Meat and Drink, were sure that Jesus and St. <hi>Paul</hi> required them to give part of all, and a Tenth part at least; nor could they fear he would take it ill that they gave more than Meat and Drink, since they did it in obedience to his command, and relying on his promise of a larger reward. Indeed the Quaker being somewhat ashamed of his former sauciness, would now pretend, <hi>He did not ask Kings by what power they altered the maintenance allotted by Christ:</hi> But if the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will but look into his first Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 319. he will find he is enquiring, <hi>What Power those Nursing Fathers</hi> (i. e. Kings and Princes) <hi>had to set out Tithes?</hi> And he asks there, <hi>where Christ gave any man such power?</hi> that is, Kings or any others: adding presently, <hi>Yet suppose the Magistrate had such a power; yet for any Magistrate to set out, &amp;c.</hi> And is not all this concerning Kings, and are not they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded among those men whom he there (<hi>Corah</hi>-like) says, <hi>Take too much upon them.</hi> 'Tis a sign he is driven to a desperate shift, when he is forced to deny his own words: But though he would evade the arrogance of
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:200297:203"/> asking Questions of Kings, yet he takes the boldness to charge them with the crime of altering the maintenance from what Christ intended: for he saith, <hi>Christ appointed the maintenance to be free;</hi> but he fancies a main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance settled by Laws ceases to be free: To which I reply, That Christ himself hath made a Law for maintenance, <hi>viz.</hi> that it shall be part of all the Believers Goods. So that even in <hi>T. E</hi>'s sense of that Law, the Christians were not left so free in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as that they might give something or nothing, or some part of one kind of their goods, and none of another: and in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his opinion, the only freedom that Christ left them, was to give more than a Tenth; and therefore if Christian Princes did make Laws that none should give less, they did not take away any freedom that Christ left his people: Besides, if Christ had left mainten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance free as to the proportion (as <hi>T. E.</hi> fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies he hath) yet I can prove by a parallel instance, that Christian Princes might just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yea and piously too, fix the proportion thereof: For Christ obliges us to provide for the poor, but hath left this provision free as to the proportion, which is no where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in Scripture; and yet our Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates have given power to certain persons to assess a fixed proportion out of every mans Estate who is of ability, and made Penal Laws to exact this fixed proportion: and dare <hi>T. E.</hi> say this is contrary to Gospel Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty? Nay, is it not a just and pious Act?
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:200297:203"/> And if a Quaker will pay this Assessment (which was left free by Christ, and is limited by Man) notwithstanding his dear Gospel Liberty, by the same reason he may pay his Tithes also. As for the Obligation which our Ancestors laid upon their Successors, it is no other method than is taken by all men, in things which they would have to continue without alteration: and since there was a settled Church, they thought it was fit it should have a settled maintenance, which it could not have, if it had been left in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of every covetous and irreligious person to give what they pleased. And whereas <hi>T. E.</hi> pretends they should not have establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what Christ revoked <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7. I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Christ is so far from revoking Tithes in that Chapter, that it affords many clear and strong Arguments for their continuance. And nothing is more absurd than his citing Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> to confirm this his pretence of those Tithes being Ceremonial, and revoked by Christ, about which we now dispute; for he thought, Tithes were no further repealed than they were Ceremonial; but the Doctor often declares, that Christian Magistrates may and ought to settle Tithes, and that in so doing they act agreeably to the Word of God, as I have shewed before: So that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, There is nothing in these Humane Laws for Tithes contrary to the revealed Will of God in Scripture, and therefore they ought to be obeyed by all good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>

Hitherto he hath been nibling at the Laws which give us this Civil Right to Tithes, upon the account of their Authors acting Popishly, the Laws themselves being unjust, the persons on whom they settle them as being of different Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, and otherwise provided for by Christ; but we have shewed the folly and falshood of all these poor Evasions, and now he quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels (to as little purpose) with the Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was one of the grounds of those Laws. And first, he labours in this Section to quit himself from the just Charge of eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a serious Answer by a petty Cavil; and cannot do it without begging of his Reader to believe that he hath proved Tithes were given to an evil end, <hi>viz.</hi> to uphold Popery and Idolatry: which I have so fully disproved before, that I will not (as he doth) spend my time in repetitions: only I affirm he was justly taxed for that evasion, because he knew my Friend and I both meant (in the sense of the Parable) <hi>viz.</hi> That it is lawful for a man to do any thing that is just, with his own, to put it to any good use he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and 'tis but an evasion to tell us, we cannot give our own to uses notoriously evil and confessedly Popish: for all this is nothing to the purpose, unless he could prove Tithes to have been as notoriously evil as whoring, or as Popish as the Idolatry of Image-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, whereas Tithes are declared to be good by Patriarchs and Prophets, by God and
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:200297:204"/> Man, by Jews and Gentiles, by the Ancient Primitive, and the Modern Protestant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and the ends of them were very pious, to support God's Worship, to remove his Judgments, to maintain his Ministers, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Churches Prayers, and to free the Ministry from those cares which would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt their devout serving God; and these indeed are those Ends which <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the very Charter where he settles Tithes: and if these be not good Ends, what are? As for the Clergy and Worship in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelwolf</hi>'s days, they are already vindicated from being Idolatrous: And yet if Tithes (which the Donors intended to give for a support of a good Ministry and a right Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship) had been a while misplaced on such a Clergy and way of Worship as was not so, yet since now they are given to a Ministry and Worship that is not Idolatrous, now they are used to a good End however, and so his Objection ceases: So that I will only note, That he either ignorantly or maliciously slanders <hi>Ethelwolf,</hi> in taxing him with laying out his money in Beads, Crucifixes, <hi>Agnus Dei</hi>'s, Pardons and Indulgences, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no ancient Author of credit that menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons any such matter, and most of these things were not come into use in <hi>Ethelwolf</hi>'s days; and to relieve a poor neighbouring Church in distress, or buy Lamps for those who wanted money to buy them for themselves, and yet could not see to read God's Word in their Churches without them, was money
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:200297:205"/> laid out to a good end, whatever the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker fancies to the contrary: Much more then were his Tithes given to a good end, <hi>viz.</hi> to maintain the Worship of God in his own Church. God himself (that is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by him in the Parable) hath assigned his own part of our Goods to this very end, and therefore to be sure this is a good end; and when Man imitates God in his Gift, and the end of his Gift too, surely he may ask the same Question with him in the Parable, <hi>May I not do what I will with my own?</hi> and then all <hi>T. E</hi>'s pretences of spending upon evil things, and giving to evil ends, will appear to be meer Cavils and Evasions; and are far from proving the Donation so invalid, as that the Laws which were grounded upon it were not fit to remain in force.</p>
               <p n="5">§. V. PAg. 352. If a bare private Dono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be a good ground of Civil Right, as our Lawyers before declared, then doubtless a Donation confirmed by a single Act of Parliament is much firmer. But what can be a stronger or better ground of Civil Right than a Donation made by the general Consent of the whole Nation at first, and confirmed by so many Laws, and in so many Parliaments, wherein all the People by their Representatives have in every Age expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely declared their Approbation thereof; and all the strength and validity that the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative Power can give to any Donation, is
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:200297:205"/> given to this of Tithes. <hi>T. E.</hi> it seems is sensible of the force of this Plea, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he slipt over five Pages before, <hi>viz. pag.</hi> 95, 96, 97, 98, and 99. and a whole Section now, <hi>viz.</hi> Sect. 29. where this consent to, and legal ratification of the Donation of Tithes, was urged: But I must take his si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence for consent to the matter of Fact, and then infer that no Lay-man can shew so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Laws, nor so allowed a Donation for his Civil Right as we have done for ours. The Quaker, it may be, dreams he can overthrow all this by a little thin Sophistry; <hi>viz.</hi> that neither <hi>Ethelwolf,</hi> nor all his People toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, could give Tithes; that is, the Tenth part of the Profits of the Land for ever: adding, that it is (to his understanding) ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly repugnant to Reason, Justice, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; yea, most ridiculous to affirm they had power to make such a Grant. This is his topping Argument of which he brags of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and which he repeats over and over; but it signifies nothing at all: For first, it is not very likely that <hi>Ethelwolf,</hi> and all his Council, and all our Kings and Parliaments almost ever since, yea, and all our Reverend Judges and skilful Lawyers, who have made, confirmed, and maintained this Grant, should be so destitute of Reason and Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, as through ignorance or design to do and declare that Act as wise, just, and good, which is so very unjust, unreasonable, and ridiculous: And 'tis an insolence scarce to be parallel'd, that a puisne Quaker, who
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:200297:206"/> never studied the Law, shall dare to say, that cannot be done, which all our Lawyers say, may be done: Yea, and to say that is silly, unjust, and ridiculous, which they say is le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, wise, and just; <hi>Ʋnicuique in suâ arte credendum;</hi> Surely all the Lawyers opinions in <hi>England,</hi> in a matter of Law and Right, will pass with sober men for Authentick, however <hi>T. E</hi>'s malice may have changed his understanding, that he doth not see it to be so. But let us hear his Arguments: He first lays down this Maxim, <hi>Nemo plus juris ad alium transferre potest quàm ipse haberet:</hi> and because no man can give more than belongs to himself, therefore no man can grant the Tenth part of the Profits for ever, since the Profits for ever, did not belong to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they depend on the stock, labour, and cost of another. The Tenth part of the Land he confesses they might grant for ever, but not the Tenth part of the Profits: This is the sum of that Argument by which he hopes to prove all the givers, confirmers, and maintainers of Tithes to be Fools and Knaves; but the Argument is to all other mens understandings unreasonable and most ridiculous: For we will grant his Maxim, That no man can convey more Right than he hath, and infer that so much Right how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he may give. Now <hi>T. E.</hi> confesses they had right to the Land, and might have granted any part of it for ever; and thence it will follow that they had right to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits also, and might have granted any part
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:200297:206"/> of them for ever: For he that granteth his Land, or any part of it, for ever, at the same time, and by the same Act, grants the Profits of that Land, or of that part of his Land, for ever; which is plain, in that the very Deeds mention, the granting of such and such Land <hi>[with all its Profits, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moluments, &amp;c.]</hi> Now if a man can give, grant, or sell the profits of his Land for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, then by the Quakers own Maxim of <hi>No man's transferring more Right than he hath;</hi> it follows, the Granter had a Right to the Profits for ever: And since the Person to whom an Estate is granted acquires a Right by that grant to the Profits for ever, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Granter must have had that Right in himself first, or else he could not have trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred it. And doubtless 'tis most ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to make such a distinction between the Land and the Profits as <hi>T. E.</hi> doth; for what is Land valuable for, but only for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits? What is considered but the Profits in either selling or letting Land? The Purchase money and the Rent is given in consideration of the Profits, and is more or less, as the Profits are more or less: For a fertile Acre will yield as much more Money or Rent as an Acre of less fruitful Land: So that 'tis certain the Right to Land for ever would signifie nothing, but only for their Right to the Profits for ever which goes along with it; wherefore if <hi>Ethelwolf,</hi> and those of that Age, had a Right to their Land for ever, they had a Right to the Profits for ever also, and
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:200297:207"/> to whomsoever they had granted their Land for ever, to them they had granted the Profits for ever also: And since they had a right to the Profits of their Land for ever as well as to the Land it self, they might convey or grant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of the Profits as well as any part of the Land: Or they might grant their Land, reserving a Tenth or other part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to be paid to the Clergy for ever. And when they had left their Land to their Sons thus charged with the payment of Tithe, those Sons could not pretend any right to that which was taken out for God and the Church by their Fathers: They could have no more right transferred to them than their Fathers had in them, when they did transfer the Land to them; but their Fathers had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed all their right to the Tenth part of the Profits unto the Clergy, before such trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring; and how many hands soever the Land hath passed through since, none of the Owners had any right in him to the Tenth part of the Profits, and so by <hi>T. E</hi>'s Maxim he could convey no such right to any Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor, and no Owner now can fairly lay claim to Tithes, because he can claim no more than his Fathers enjoyed, which was the whole Land with Nine parts of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits.</p>
               <pb n="365" facs="tcp:200297:207"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 354. This power of granting some part of the Profits for ever, I did in my 30th and 38th Sections illustrate by a perpetual Rent-charge, to which I fitly compared Tithes, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> also doth, <hi>History of Tithes, pag.</hi> 73, 114, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not as though they were alike in all things [for then they would be the very same;] But because Tithes and perpetual Rent-charges agree in the matter about which we dispute: For a perpetual Rent-charge, is a grant of some certain part of the Profits of an Estate for ever, to which part of the Profits the succeeding Heirs or Occupants have no right, though they do procure this, as well as the rest of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, by their labour, skill, and the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their stock: So that an ancient Owner may alienate some part of the Profits of his Land for ever, and may oblige all succeeeding Owners and Occupants to raise this part of the Profits out of their stock and labour, and pay it as that ancient Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er did direct: And if this can be done by the private Deed of one Subject, how much more may it be done by the general Consent of all the Owners in the Kingdom, and by thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or forty Acts of Parliament and Publick Laws to confirm such a Grant? But further, if a perpetual Rent-charge be a reasonable and just Grant, then that ancient Owner who granted it, had a right to the Profits of his Estate for ever, or otherwise he could not reasonably and justly reserve some
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:200297:208"/> part of these Profits for ever, or ingage them to be paid to his Assigns for ever, and if the ancient Owners had a right to the Profits for ever, and could reserve any part of them, and engage them to be paid to their Assigns for ever, then they might reserve and assign over the Tenth part of the Profits for ever to the Clergy, and consequently the Grant of Tithes is neither unreasonable nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just: And indeed that which makes it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable and just for an ancient Owner to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige all succeeding Owners and Occupants to pay a certain part of the Profits in money or in kind, is, because he (who might have sold the whole Land) leaves them his Land to raise the Profits out of, which Profits can no more be raised without Land, than without stock and pains, wherefore since his Land contributes towards the raising of these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, he may in consideration thereof justly claim a power to dispose of some part of those Profits either in kind or in money, and this Reason will hold in Tithes as well as Rent-charges, for thus far they do agree, and that which justifies the one justifies the other. But <hi>T. E.</hi> fancies he answers this Argument with objecting some differences between Tithes and Rent-charges, whereas those differences are nothing to the matter in dispute. First, He urges that a Rent-charge is laid upon the Land, and Tithes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise out of the Profits raised by the Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pants stock, and that for Non-payment of a Rent-charge the Land is forfeited, but not
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:200297:208"/> for Non-payment of Tithes. I reply, Rent-charges are due and payable out of the Profits only as well as Tithes; for Land that yields no profit, can neither secure nor pay a Rent-charge: and Tithes are charged on the Land as well as Rent-charges; whence that Maxim among our Lawyers, <hi>All Land in</hi> England <hi>is originally charged with Tithes:</hi> and these Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, <hi>Lands charged with Tithes and discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of them.</hi> Besides, there are some Rent-charges, the Penalty for Non-payment whereof, is (not entring upon the Land, but) entring upon the stock, and out of it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring satisfaction. Again, there are some Tithes which do not include the Husband-mans stock nor charge, as in the Tithe of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistment, where the Parson puts in the Tenth Horse or Ox, &amp;c. and eats that Grass which springs by God's Providence without the Husband-mans charge: this sort of Tithe therefore doth not lie upon the stock, pains, and charge of the Occupant; and the case is not much different in Tithe-hay, wood, fruit, &amp;c. But let the Tithe or the Rent-charge be of what kind they will, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain they are both paid out of the Profits of the Land, which Land the ancient Owner left so charged; and though Rent-charges and Tithes be not secured the same way, the Penalty for neglect of the one being entring on the Land (only till they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imbursed) or seizing the stock: the Penalty for the other being treble damages and costs of Sute; yet both Tithes and Rent-charges
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:200297:209"/> are well secured, so well that 'tis dangerous▪ to detain either; and the different sort of security doth not make any difference in the justice of the payment: for a Debt secured by Bond may be as just a Debt as that which is secured by Mortgage; and so Tithes secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Statute Law may be as just a payment as a Rent-charge secured by a private Deed. A man doth not forfeit his Land for ever (as <hi>T. E.</hi> mistakes) by Non-payment of Rent-charge, only he wants the profit of it till the Party be re-imbursed; and a man may in few years time, if he be sued at Law, lose the value of his Land in not paying Tithes for it, <hi>Jam sumus ergo pares:</hi> But indeed in all other differences between Tithes and Rent-charges, Tithes are the more reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and just payment of the two. Rent-charges cannot be paid out of the Profits till they be sold and turned into money, but Tithe is paid out of the Profits made ready upon the place only: Rent-charges (as the Quaker himself notes) are a certain sum of money, and must be paid to the full, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Profits of the Land in one year will do it or no: But Tithes are only a certain part of what God sends to grow or renew, if little, the Tithe is less, and it is not more unless the Crop be more also. In Rent-charges neither the present Owner nor Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupant do or can expect to receive any thing from those they pay to; but in Tithes both Owner and Occupant do receive (or may, if they please) instruction, exhortation, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:200297:209"/> and reproof in order to their everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Salvation, from him they pay to, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. 11. thus far then Tithes are the more just and reasonable payment. And in other matters they agree. Were Rent-charges laid on by the right Owners? so were Tithes. Are they well secured by Law? so are Tithes. Doth the present Owner or Occupant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Land charged with a Rent-charge? so he doth with Tithes. Is the one a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den which the Law makes to descend with the Inheritance? so is the other. Has the Occupant or Owner no satisfaction for his pains and charges in raising or paying Tithes? (which <hi>T. E.</hi> asserts) 'tis certain he hath no satisfaction for raising and paying a Rent-charge. Is the Purchaser and Tenant abated proportionably in consideration of a Rent-charge? so I shall prove they are in conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Tithes. So that the Quaker in yielding Rent-charges are just and reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, doth by fair and firm consequence grant Tithes to be so also. Having therefore proved that, I shall only remark the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers falshood in saying, our Ancestors took great care to secure Rent-charges by legal settlements, but made no provision for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tithes but by Ecclesiastical censures, for some hundred of years after they were given: and thence he would insinuate, they intended Tithes should depend upon Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. All which is monstrously untrue, for there are Laws made by our Kings and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments to enjoyn the true payment of Tithes, and Penalties to be inflicted by the
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:200297:210"/> Civil Magistrate upon the breakers of those Laws within one hundred years after <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wolfe</hi>'s Donation, and five hundred years el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than any Law which he can find for Rent-charges; if the Suits for Tithes were after the Conquest restrained to the Court-Christian, it was because, in those Ages, that Court had more power than any other, and was the surest and speediest way for recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. And our Ancestors were so far from intending Tithes should depend on the Devotion of their Successors, that the very Donation it self, is expresly said (by the Recorders of it) to be <hi>for a Patrimony,</hi> and <hi>for a Dowry to the Church;</hi> and they bound their Heirs under grievous Curses and severe Penalties to pay Tithes which undeniably shew, they intended not to leave them to the good will of their Posterity. Finally we see that for Ancient Owners to grant a part of the Profits for ever, is a fact done fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and allowed as wise, just, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable by all sorts of men, yea confessed (under the name and in the case of Rent-charges) by the Quaker himself. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for him to exclaim against this grant of part of the profits for ever, to argue it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done, or ought not to be done, and is an unreasonable, unjust, and most ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thing; is such a profession against mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, as signifies nothing at all, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less <hi>T. E.</hi> be the only wise and reasonable man in the World, unless he alone is to hold the Scales of Justice, and determine of right and wrong; for herein his Protestation
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:200297:210"/> is contrary to the allowed practice of all mankind. I gave divers other instances of such kind of grants, with reasons to prove the Equity of them, from <hi>pag.</hi> 166, to <hi>pag.</hi> 171. the greatest part of which my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary passeth by, so that I shall give some few more instances of the granting a part of the profits in Specie, and then conclude this Section. <hi>Joseph</hi> (whose wisdom and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity <hi>T. E.</hi> dare not question) did bind the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to Till the Land, and out of the profits procured by their cost, pains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to give the King a Fifth part (which is a double Tithe) in Specie, nor was this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for his own time, but he made it a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and perpetual Law, with the consent of the people of that Age to bind their Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Gen.</hi> xlvii. 26. although these profits would not arise without the stock, labour, and cost of those who were to occupy the Land in the next Generation; yet, surely <hi>T. E.</hi> will not say this was unreasonable or ridiculous. Again, I know a Gentleman, who by way of a Free-Rent out of his Estate, paies to the chief Lord (my Neighbour) a certain number of Quarters of Barley every year; and of old most of the Rents of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were a part of the profits in Specie, and so they are still in many parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally our Colledges have divers Lands, the Occupiers whereof do pay so many Quarters of Whet or Barley every year produced by their stock, pains, and charge; and a Statute Law declares this to be just and fitting, 18 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 6. which
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:200297:211"/> shews that the Owners of the Land may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a part of the profits in Specie for ever, without any injustice; and if they may reserve them to their own use, and the use of their Successors or Heirs for ever, they may grant them to others also, if they be Lords in Fee of the Land out of which these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits are by them granted.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. PAg. 359. When I charge <hi>T. E.</hi> with censuring Kings, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Judges, and Lawyers; yea, Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> himself, <hi>Hist. Tithes,</hi> p. 129, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (who have made or allowed this Grant of part of the Profits) as unreasonable, unjust and ridiculous People; he quietly takes to it: and it may be 'tis no sin in the Quakers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly Religion, to speak evil of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and judge those that are their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours and Betters. But he cannot digest my charge of Blasphemy, nor will he yield, that what he said in disparagement of this Grant of a Tenth part of the profits for ever, did reflect upon Almighty God, though he real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made such a Grant as this, which <hi>T. E.</hi> calls unreasonable, unjust, and ridiculous: for he now pretends, he only said it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, unjust, and ridiculous for any <hi>Man</hi> to claim the power of Granting such part of the profits for ever: But 'tis like, this evasion was devised since my Objection, for his former Discourse was directly bent, to prove the thing unjust, unreasonable and ridiculous in it self, without any considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Person doing it, and that (I am sure) is no less than Blasphemy; nor will it
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:200297:211"/> wholly clear him to say, that it is only so evil and foolish in men to make this Grant, because those men who made this Grant, were induced to make it by God's Example, never dreaming of any bold Quakers, who would censure them for those Acts wherein they imitated him who is equity it self; and indeed to censure such Imitation, is to reflect upon God himself, nor doth it help him to plead God might do this, because <hi>He had a Right to the sweat and pains, charge and care of all the Owners of</hi> Canaan, <hi>as he gave them their Land, Life, Health, and Strength, as they received all from him, and owed all to him.</hi> For this was not peculiar to the Jews, God hath the same right to our sweat, pains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as he had to theirs; he gives us our Land and Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as well as he gave them theirs; we receive all from him, as well as they: for sure he will not say they only were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to Providence. This reason con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues still, and therefore it is as just and reasonable for God to require Tithes of us, as of the Jews, and we have proved in the first part, he doth so; and <hi>Ethelwolfe</hi> to be sure was of that Opinion, yea, <hi>T. E.</hi> must Grant (even while he obstinately denies that God doth now require Tithes) that he reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and justly might require them because those reasons, which he gives to prove it just and reasonable for God to require Tithes of the Jews, are still in force. Well then <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wolfe</hi> knowing God might require Tithes now (for we will go no higher here) and considering that all Owners in <hi>England,</hi>
                  <pb n="374" facs="tcp:200297:212"/> through all Generations were like to receive all their Land and profits too, with the Life, Health, and Strength, by which they were enabled to procure and enjoy them; wisely, justly, and reasonably re-inforced so much of Gods Law by this Donation, as did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon this continuing reason, and was never repealed. And he that censures such a Law of man as is made in imitation of the Law of God, and grounded on the same reason with it, he doth Blaspheme the Law of God. Nor is there any fear that the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Ethelwolfe</hi> power to follow God's Example in making this Law for Tithes, would allow Princes power to set up Jewish Ceremonies, for the reasons on which the Laws for <hi>Levitical</hi> Ceremonies were ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are now ceased: and yet, as it would have been blaspemous to say any of those Ceremonies were unreasonable and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, while the reasons continued, for which God did institute them: so it can be little less to say so of Tithes, since this very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son which proves it was once a just Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, is still in force, and will be so for ever. Nor will the Priests (as he fancies) be against the King's imitating God's pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern in the matter of the <hi>Levites</hi> having no Inheritance among the People: For God did not take any Land from the <hi>Levites</hi> of which he found them possessed. And <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> God made so liberal a provision for them by Tithes, Oblations, Cities, and Suburbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they needed no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try lying together as the other Tribes had,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:200297:212"/> being the most liberally and nobly provided for of all; and if any King will do as much for the Clergy, as God did for the <hi>Levites,</hi> no question they will count it a very good Act. But this is a digression, wherefore we return to the Point, and conclude, that in this Case, where <hi>Ethelwolfe</hi>'s Act was an Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of what God had done, and was grounded upon the same reason that God's Act was grounded; there we cannot censure his Act as unreasonable, unjust, or ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous without Blasphemy against the Divine Majesty; Thus the Quakers prime Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment makes him appear a most unjust, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, and ridiculous Person.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. PAg. 364. His next Cavil against the Donation, was that the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon which Tithes were given, is now taken away. To this I replied before in my 31 §. <hi>p.</hi> 174, 175, 176, 177. shewing, 1. That the meriting remission by good works in the Popish sense, was not believed in that Age, and so could not be the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. 2. That in the sense they meant it, it was a good consideration, and is not taken away. 3. That however it being no condition of the Donation, but at most a motive inciting thereto, the Donation is not made void, although this consideration were taken away. To this last <hi>T. E.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies nothing at all, and to the two former nothing to the purpose, for he now begs in vain of intelligent Readers to believe that
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:200297:213"/> the <hi>Saxons</hi> were Papists in point of Merits, it being fully cleared both in my former Book and this, that this charge is unjust, and that all their expressions, sounding that way, are innocent and agreeable to Scripture, and the sayings of the most Orthodox Fathers. He sings indeed his old Song over again about the Church, then being a Popish Church, for confutation whereof I refer the Reader to its proper place. And only observe that in <hi>Ethelwolf</hi>'s time, there was a true visible Church in <hi>England,</hi> a Ministry not teaching any damnable Error, by whose Preaching and Prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Salvation might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; and it was for the Maintenance of this Church and Ministry that Tithes were given; and this consideration was then good, and is so now; for we have a visible Church still, we have Souls to save, and Sins to be remitted, and we have Ministers to whom the Ministry of that reconciliation (which Christ purchased) is committed; and by whose Preaching and Prayers, Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be obtained, and therefore to give Tithes to uphold this Ministry, is a good consideration still, and so our Law-givers (who are Judges of the goodness of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration) did believe, and therefore even those that were Protestants do confirm and maintain this Gift, as being grounded on that which is a good consideration now: One touch he gives about the praying to Saints, in which the very words of the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confute him, which are (as the three
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:200297:213"/> principal Relators tell us) <hi>That they</hi> (i. e. the Clergy) <hi>may so much the more diligently, and without ceasing</hi> Pour <hi>out their</hi> Prayers <hi>to</hi> God <hi>for us.</hi> Ingulph. Malms. <hi>M.</hi> Westm. Observe it is not <hi>to the Saints,</hi> but <hi>to God:</hi> And was this an evil consideration that they might pray to God for the King and the Kingdom? None will say so but such as wish the ruin of both. I note also, that he cunningly and fallaciously inserts the two hundred Marks <hi>per Annum</hi> for the Lamps at <hi>Rome,</hi> among the pious uses to which Tithes were given, when that was a distinct gift at another time: But I must not ramble after him, but content my self at present, in that I have made it plain that the considerations on which Tithes were given, are good and in force now. And yet, if they were as bad as he would make them, being no conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or proviso's, upon failing of which the Donation should have been void, but meer Motives to incite the Donors, the Donation ought to stand, even though they should fail. Noting withal that the failing of these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations now, doth not hurt the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for 'tis not we but our Ancestors that gave Tithes; and since they did believe them good considerations, that made their Donation right and firm at first, and since they made the Donation upon good conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations then, it stands so still. There are many persons now in <hi>England</hi> that enjoy Estates, and other Priviledges, by Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made upon considerations that were good
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:200297:214"/> when the Donations were made, and such as the Donors thought good considerations, which are now wholly taken away, and yet they will think <hi>T. E.</hi> very unjust, if he should take away that which was so given them, the Endowments of Hospitals, and the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Cities; yea, <hi>Magna Charta</hi> it self might suffer by this kind of Logick, only the Priests would gain by one instance very considerably, <hi>viz.</hi> The Tithes of all Land belonging to the <hi>Cistercian</hi> Monks; for the consideration on which this Priviledge was given them, is now most certainly taken away, and <hi>T. E.</hi> may do well to see if he can perswade them who enjoy this Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge now to quit it, and pay their Tithes intire.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. PAg. 369. If my Adversary had not forgot he is arguing against the Clergys Civil Right to Tithes, methinks he should not have persisted in so absurd an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that we have no such right to them now, <hi>Because they were given to a Popish Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy:</hi> which if it could be proved (as 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it cannot) would no more hurt our Civil Right to them, now that the Law hath settled them on the Protestant Clergy; than it hurts <hi>Magna Charta</hi> that it was made to Popish Subjects; or the Charters of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that they were made to Popish Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens; or the Donations to old Hospitals and Alms-houses, that they were made to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:200297:214"/> poor, and this last is also a Religious Donation. This might become a Jesuites mouth to justifie their plotting to strip the Protestants of all, as having no right to any thing they possess, but it sounds odiously in the mouth of a pretended Protestant. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>T. E.</hi> knows that the alteration of mens opinion, doth not take away their Civil Right; if so, <hi>T. E.</hi> hath forfeited his Civil Right, if he had any, by turning Quaker; and all those whose Ancestors were Papists when their Estates were settled, should now lose their Titles in becoming Protestants. But we need not further expose the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed consequences of this Argument, because it is already proved that <hi>Ethelwolfe</hi>'s Clergy were no Papists; and <hi>T. E.</hi> despairing to make it out by any thing of his own, would pervert two passages of my Friends and mine to insinuate that we own they were Popish, but all in vain. My Friend indeed did say that most of the present Superstitions of Popery had their Original between the year 700. and the year 1400. But then it was the Midnight of that Period, which (he said) bred and nursed up Invocation of Saints, Worship of Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Friends account, about the year 1050. which is near two hundred years after this Donation. And if some Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions had begun about the beginning of this time, yet they were but in their infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy at the time of the Donation, held by few, and those private persons not received in the
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:200297:215"/> Church, nor imposed as Articles of Faith, so that they could not justly denominate the then Church or Clergy, Popish; especially since to the honour both of the old <hi>Saxon</hi> and present <hi>English</hi> Church, we have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they both agreed in the most principal Doctrines of the pure and Primitive Church, from which <hi>Rome</hi> hath now so grosly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. Again, he saith, that I confess, <hi>The benefit of this Donation hath been enjoyed for eight hundred years by those to whom it was made;</hi> and yet all the time of Popery it was enjoyed by a Popish Clergy, and if it was enjoyed by them to whom it was made all the while, then it must needs be made to a Popish Clergy; of this poor fallacy he is so conceited as that he Triumphs and Crows, <hi>This is unavoidable;</hi> but I see nothing in it that I should fear or avoid, for I did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider those to whom the Donation was made under any other Notion than that of their Office, as Clergy-men and Ministers publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allowed, nor did I say they were of the same Opinion all the while, and I may say of an Hospital Founded in King <hi>Stephen</hi>'s daies that the Donation hath been enjoyed five Hundred years by them to whom it was made, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Poor, though some of them were Papists and others Protestants, yet all were Poor, and as such only I consider them in this Expression: So here the Donation was made to the Clergy, and the Clergy hath enjoyed it this eight hundred years; and 'tis a ridiculous inference to say, That
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:200297:215"/> because they were Papists some part of the eight hundred years, therefore they were so when the Donation was made; at that rate I might prove <hi>Ethelwolfe</hi>'s Clergy Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, and because the Clergy were Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants some part of the eight hundred years, shall I thence infer they were Protestants to whom the Donation was made? My Cause neither needs nor desires such foppery; Tithes were intended to an Orthodox Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and to such (in the main) they were given, and by those of that Function they have been enjoyed ever since. The Clergy were indeed corrupted for some time in the middle of this eight hundred years, but they are now reformed again, and have been near two hundred years, and our Law-givers and Princes have declared that this Reformed Ministry have a right to that which was first given to a sound Clergy, and then a while enjoyed by a corrupt Clergy, and now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to a sound Clergy again: But they were Clergy all the time, and that justifies my Expression; and not only cuts off all those malicious consequences that the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker would draw from it; but shews what base Artifices <hi>T.E.</hi> is forced to use, to make his ignorant Quakers believe that <hi>Ethelwolfe</hi>'s Clergy were as much a Popish Clergy as those in Queen <hi>Marys</hi> daies, a thing which he himself contradicts elsewhere, when he grants that Popery came in by degrees. And yet after all this wretched Sophistry, if they to whom the Donation was made, had been
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:200297:216"/> as gross Papists as his vile slanders would represent them, yet that would not take away their Civil Right to Tithes, while the Laws of the Land (the Arbiters of Civil Right) declared Tithes did belong to them, even as <hi>Rivet.</hi> but now affirmed the present Clergy in Popish Countries have a Civil Right to the Tithes there, much less could it hurt our Civil Right now, since the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not made to them as Popish but as Clergy, and since the Legislative Power hath declared our Civil Right to them, and owns us alone as the true Ministers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which sufficiently baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles all his fallacious arguings; wherefore let me observe that <hi>T. E.</hi> is here again work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Journey-work for the Popish Priests ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his poor Talent labouring to prove Tithes due to them by the first Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a prescription of six hundred years, against the time that they be enabled to make their claim by the help of their good Friends the Quakers, who, as I noted in my former Book, hold some of the worst &amp; most dangerous Opinions of <hi>Rome,</hi> but my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary was so busie in Weaving this Spiders Web, that he had no leisure to vindicate his Friends, or else his sense of their guilt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived him of all power to reply.</p>

Another pretence to take away the Clergys Civil Right to Tithes, is, <hi>That they neither do any thing now, nor have any thing to do for the People that can deserve so great a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation;</hi> To which I need reply no more, than that it is enough to secure their Civil Right to Tithes, if they do so much as the Laws of the Land, make the condition of their enjoying them; But I know they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally do much more than any Human Laws require of them; their Youth and their Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are spent in fitting them for their great work, and their time, their parts and strength laid out in it: so that very many of them do contract incurable Diseases, and shorten their Lives by the excessive pains they take; and is this nothing? I instanced before in the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Offices we perform; but <hi>T. E.</hi> objects, we are paid for most of them besides. He cannot deny but that our Prayers and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the constant and most painful parts of our Office, have no other compensation but Tithes; and for those Offices in extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, we do them for many that pay us no Tithes at all, and do them <hi>gratis</hi> for the Poor, and the Fees (which were free Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at first, by long custom become legal Dues) if we should take them, are so small, as Two at <hi>Easter,</hi> One for Baptizing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that men of generous Education (as most of the Clergy are) would not do the work
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:200297:217"/> for ten times so much Money, if they were to be hired to it, and were not obliged in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science thereunto. And let it be observed, that it is a great Argument of the Clergys moderation, in that they have not altered these Fees for some Centuries, when all other sorts of men in the Nation have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced their Fees in great proportions: and withal that these payments are so very mean, that in a Parish containing Five thousand Communicants, a poor Vicar that hath lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle left but these Fees (which are almost his whole compensation) can scarce get Clothes to his back, and Bread for his Family: which shews how little occasion there was for <hi>T.

                  </note>. And if the Reader please to look back to his 112 Page, he will find this very man arguing, that a Ministry may be very serviceable even to those who knew the Truth already, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting them to keep to it, and putting them in mind of their Duty. So then this Applying what was plain before, is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for a Ministry to do when it serves his Turn, but now (when it makes against him) it is nothing: What Conscience, or sense of Honesty is there in such a Writer? <hi>Secondly,</hi> When I reckon confuting Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and shewing the folly of such Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers as <hi>T.

<pb n="386" facs="tcp:200297:218"/> of Learning) for an expert School-boy. And indeed his dreaming that any of the Clergy made the confuting of him the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their discourse in their accidental Meetings, puts me in mind of the ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Souldier in the old Comoedian, who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some whisper (that indeed were derid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him) strutted about and said, <hi>I will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear great, for these men are admiring me!</hi> I am sure I never was in any company of Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-men that admired any thing but his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence; for all I have met with, saw his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance through that thin Veil of his Craft, which only hides him from his short-sighted Quakers. But as to his confutation, the Clergy have their Tithes for their constant Duty, and yet they are really very servicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Nation, who will give themselves the trouble of Checking such insolent abuses of the Established Religion and Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as his Book abounds withal.</p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. PAg. 379. Hitherto the Quaker hath in vain attempted to prove, That the Laws of the Land cannot, or ought not, to give the present Clergy any Civil Right to Tithes, not sparing to suggest that such Laws are unjust, and all along insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating that the payment is unreasonable; yea, in his first Book he expresly calls them an <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,</hi> p. 331. And when I seriously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved this abuse of our Laws and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers, he calls it a piece of Mirth, and so
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:200297:218"/> passes it. But now we should come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the particular Laws for Tithes, and the sense of them, <hi>T. E.</hi> begins to make Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies, saying, <hi>It is no wonder if he be defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in point of Law, having never been edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in that Study.</hi> I may add, nor in the Study of Divinity neither, and therefore it is no wonder that he is defective in both; the only wonder is, that he should write so confidently of that which he understands not, and so audaciously contradict, and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently censure both Lawyers and Divines; that he should brag he had removed Positive Laws, who doth neither know what they are, nor what they mean: this may stand for a wonder. The first Parliament Law he could find among our Statutes for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tithes, was the 27 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. But I had told him in my former Book, where to find several Ancienter Laws for this pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>pag.</hi> 97, 98. which were made by our <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings in their Great Councils, which we call Parliaments, and which were so far from being Repealed, that all those old Laws, and this for Tithes among the rest, were collected into one Body by King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Confessor; and these were those Laws which our Kings since the Conquest did generally swear to maintain; and the sum of these Laws of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor is <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> that great Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Rights, Properties, and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of all the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy as well as Laiety, which Charter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:200297:219"/> stands foremost among our Statute Laws, being it confirms all the preceding good Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and is a ground for all that follow; a Charter made most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly with dreadful Curses on the Infrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. <hi>Flet.</hi> l. 2. cap. 42. <hi>Speed</hi> l. 9. c. 9. §. 82. And confirmed as my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> observes in thirty two Parliaments since, <hi>Proem. ad In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitut. l.</hi> 2. And the very first Article of this Charter, and first Law of our Statute Book is, <hi>That the Church of</hi> England <hi>shall be free, and have all her whole Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties inviolable.</hi> Now undoubtedly when this Charter was made, the Clergy had a Civil Right to Tithes at least, by Donation, Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, Prescription, and many Positive Laws. And my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> saith this Law provides, <hi>That all Ecclesiastical Persons shall enjoy all their lawful Jurisdiction, and other their Rights, without any diminution or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.</hi> Instit. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 3. This therefore is a Law to prohibit detaining or taking away of Tithes, and to continue the payment (then in use) for ever, since now they cannot be taken away without the Breach of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and therefore this one Law is as good as a thousand. As for the Statutes of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, they were not made till that King and his Parliament had renounced the main Pillar of Popery, <hi>viz.</hi> the Pope's Supremacy, which was the first step of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and that which shortly brought in the Protestant Religion: But if he and they were Papists when they made this Law,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:200297:219"/> so was <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. when he made <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> yet surely <hi>T. E.</hi> dares not say, that <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and all Acts of Parliament made by Papists are void, especially not this for Tithes which was grounded on a Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Protestant Doctrine (as is proved) and was repeated and improved by a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant King and Parliament afterwards; and not only so, but those thirty two Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners impowered by Act of Parliament to reform the Laws of the Church, who finished not that Work till Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, the Compilers of which were eight Bishops, eight Divines, eight Civilians, and eight Common-Lawyers, all Protestants; these in that Title, <hi>De decimis,</hi> have fully declared that the Clergies Right to Tithes is a Protestant Opinion, <hi>Reform.

In fine, there are Laws enough, and those strong enough to declare (as an Author of great Judgment in these matters speaks) <hi>That if this of Tithes be not a debt to the receiver, a yearly profit issuing out of the Land to anothers use by Law, nothing is due here in</hi> England. <hi>Civil R. of Tithes, pag.</hi> 308.

                  <pb n="390" facs="tcp:200297:220"/>§. 11. PAg. 383. I went on to consider the sense of the Laws for Tithes, affirming that as they are now set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, they are a Free-hold to the Clergy. But the Quaker falsly charges me with cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him Heretick for questioning this, for it was in the Page before that I likened him to the Hereticks in St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>Jude</hi> for despising Dominions, and speaking evil of Dignities, and things he doth not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand. I do indeed deservedly tax his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and confidence, for denying and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputing against the concurrent Judgment of our Judges and Lawyers in a Point of Law, but I know every <hi>Ignoramus</hi> is not an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. Now when I have produced my proofs out of those that are learned in the Laws, to demonstrate Tithes are a Free-hold: he thinks to evade them all by pretending, <hi>He doth not profess himself a Lawyer.</hi> This had been a good reason why he should not have attacked the Positive Laws; but we see he is not so very nice of stepping into other mens Professions, but that he would have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured on a piece of Law, if he had any to oppose my clear proofs; and the true reason of his silence, is not (that vertue so rarely found among Quakers) Modesty; but want of somewhat plausible enough to object: So that I will refer the Reader to my 184 <hi>page,</hi> where I have plainly proved, that the Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of a Free-hold doth exactly agree to Tithes, and that the Opinion of our Lawyers,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:200297:220"/> and practice of our Laws declare them so to be, and this will bring in another branch of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> to secure the Clergies right to Tithes, <hi>viz.</hi> Chap. 29. <hi>That none shall be disseized of his Free-hold, but by the judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land.</hi> Now though the matter be so plain, yet <hi>T. E.</hi> must seem to say something, and therefore he charges me with confounding the claims of the Priest and the Impropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, alledging that the clause of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, where mention is made of a Free-hold in Tithes, hath relation to the Impropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: Which I never denied, nor did I bring in that passage to any other intent than to shew, <hi>That Tithes may be a Free-hold;</hi> and if they may be so in Temporal hands, there is no reason why they should not be so in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical, for that and all other Statutes do declare the one to have as good Right to them as the other, and prescribe the same methods of recovery to the Clergy that they do to the Laiety, and the Penalties for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining these dues from the one, are as great as for detaining them from the other, which shews the Laws thought their Rights equal, and that both the Priest and Impropriator had a Free-hold in their Tithes, and these words, <hi>Free-hold in Tithes made Temporal,</hi> &amp;c. seem to suppose that Spiritual Persons had a Free-hold in them also. Only since there is (as I noted before) two sorts of Free-holds, one that is holden unto a man and his heirs, another for term of Life, the
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:200297:221"/> Laiety (by the Laws now in force) have the first sort of Free-hold, and the Clergy have the second; for Tithes are not less a Free-hold to the Clergy, because they cannot make Joyntures to their Wives, nor set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements to their Heirs out of them, because none that is a Free-holder only for term of Life can do that, and yet he is as truly a Free-holder that holds for term of life, as he that holds to him and his Heirs: So that the Quaker mistakes my intent, in bringing in the Case of that Countess, whose Dowry in Tithes was counted a Free-hold, for that was mentioned, to shew that they who have but a Tenure in Dower (which is but such a life Estate in Tithes as the Clergy have) the Law judges these to have a Free-hold in them; and the Case of younger Brothers who have only Life Estates in Tithes, is the very same: so that my Argument runs thus, If the Clergy have as good a Tenure in Tithes as any Lay persons who hold them only for term of life, and those of the Laie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty who hold them no otherwise, have a Free-hold in them; then the Clergy have so also: which being (as I have shewed) the sense of our Laws and Lawyers, it follows that they may, by vertue of this Free-hold in Tithes, vote for Burgesses in Parliament as well as any other Free-holders that hold on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for term of life, and not only Ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom (which is as strong as Law in <hi>England</hi>) confirms this Right of Voting, but reason also pleads for it, in regard these Burgesses
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:200297:221"/> do propose Laws that concern the Clergy as well as the Laiety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 387. But it seems <hi>T. E.</hi> doth not think these Laws make for him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he begins to disparage them with the old false charge of being grounded not on a Primitive and Protestant Doctrine, but a Popish, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Tithes were due to God and holy Church:</hi> which Doctrine I have justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to be both Primitive and Protestant by clear Testimonies of Primitive Fathers and Protestant Divines, and Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> will tell him that the Popes principal Emissaries and Agents the Friars, Preached down this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and agreed with <hi>Wickliff,</hi> in holding Tithes to be pure Alms to be disposed at the peoples pleasure. <hi>Hist. of Tithes, c.</hi> 7. §. 4. <hi>p.</hi> 165. and <hi>pag.</hi> 166. These Popish Friars taught the People they were not bound to pay them by any Law of God: which is a better proof that it was not a Popish Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, than the <hi>Bohemians</hi> taking away Tithes, can be that it was not a Protestant Doctrine, for 'tis more certain the Fryars were Papists, than that the <hi>Bohemians</hi> were Protestants, <hi>T. E.</hi> can no otherwise prove them Protestants than by Mr. <hi>Foxe</hi>'s calling them so, and 'tis certain they lived long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the name of Protestant was heard of in the World, nor can they be called by that name without a gross <hi>Soloecism</hi> in Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. Besides divers that were certainly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants did retain Tithes, and hold them
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:200297:222"/> due to God and Holy Church, and these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing far more in number, and more Orthodox in Judgment, do shew it was a Protestant as well as a Primitive Doctrine, on which these Statutes were grounded. And these Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes did find and do suppose we had an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent spiritual right, but because men void of the fear of God would not be directed by the Spiritual Law, being only in awe of Temporal punishments, therefore (as the very Statutes declare) they appoint Tithes to be paid under such Temporal penalties as might terrifie those from detaining them who valued no other punishments: They did not take away our Spiritual Rights, but secured them to us by another Right, even such an one as Temporal Laws can only give, <hi>i. e. a Civil Right:</hi> for whatever a Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law commands to be paid to any man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Temporal penalties, he hath a Civil Right thereto, and if it were due to him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any other consideration before, That consideration is not taken away by this su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervening Law. And we need not claim Tithes only in that Notion wherein the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes suppose them due, but in that Notion wherein they make them due also, the one being the reason of the other, and both these Titles being very consistent with one another, as I proved before, by the instance of a father, who hath a right to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by his Son <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> and yet by a Deed of settlement he hath also a Right to the same <hi>Jure Humano;</hi> and if the said Deed
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:200297:222"/> did express it, as the consideration why the Son settled this Maintenance on his Father, <hi>viz.</hi> because it was due to him by Gods Law; nevertheless the Father might still claim it as a due to him (now this Deed is superadded) <hi>Jure Humano;</hi> he hath both a Divine and a Human Right also. And this instance is the more proper, because Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters are called Fathers, not (as the Quaker speaks) through a mistake committed by darkness and ignorance, for St. <hi>Paul</hi> so stiles himself, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 15. yea, <hi>The Scripture counts him our Father, who instructs us in the Law of God.</hi> Mos. Gerund. <hi>in</hi> 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> xi. 2. and St. <hi>Hierom</hi> calls the Bishops, <hi>The Father of our Souls.</hi> Epist. ad <hi>Nepot.</hi> But the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers new Light hath taught him to count St. <hi>Paul</hi> and every body else in the dark but himself, who yet is so ignorant that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not understand how a man can have a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral or Civil Right to a Spiritual profit, whereas let the thing be what it will, if a Temporal Law declare it shall be paid to me, and appoint Penalties for those that detain it from me, That Law gives me a Civil Right to it: As in the Case of the King's Supremacy, and his Tenths, the one is a Spiritual Right, and the other a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual profit, and yet those Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that settle them on the King, give him a Civil Right to them. And suppose a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous person by his Deed shall settle 20 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> on the Minister of such a Parish for ever: this is a Spiritual profit, and yet <hi>T.E.</hi>
                  <pb n="396" facs="tcp:200297:223"/> surely will grant, that by vertue of that deed the Person hath a Civil Right to it; and for the jumble he makes about the words in the Statute, <hi>Tithes made Temporal:</hi> had he read on, he might have found the meaning of that Phrase, <hi>viz. —or admitted to be, abide, and go to, or in Temporal hands, and Lay-uses and profits:</hi> which words expound the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and teach us that Tithes are said to be made Temporal, when they are possessed by Temporal Persons, and employed to Lay-uses: But he knows that Statute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, That Ecclesiastical persons shall have Tithes paid to them as well as Lay-men, and by vertue of that Statute the Priest may claim Tithes as well as the Impropriator, and therefore that Temporal Law gives the Priest a Temporal Right to them. But this is one of the Quakers old fallacies by which he would cut off the Priests from all benefit by the Laws of the Land, a thing that St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> cries out of as a most unjust absurd project; <hi>Shall the Common-Law</hi> (saith he) <hi>be shut to no other Subjects but to the Clergy alone, who pray for all other men, and have an Office laid upon them for the good of all?</hi> Ambr. <hi>ad</hi> Valentin.

I have read of a <hi>Dacian</hi> Prince, who being straitly Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged, and having scarce any men left alive to defend his City, stuffed the Skins of those which his Enemies had slain, and set them up against the Wall, as if they had stood to defend them, only to abuse the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siegers into a belief that he had yet many Forces remaining: And <hi>T. E.</hi> is in the same streight, and uses the same trick in repeating his old baffled Arguments, which since I know to be but stuffed Skins, he must not be angry that I do not spend my Artillery on them. I have sufficiently proved that the Owners have a right to the profits for ever, and may grant any part of them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will not be so prodigal of my own and my Readers time as to repeat my Answers so often as he vainly repeats his poor Objections. But shall consider his next Question, <hi>Whether the Property of Tithes be vested in the Person of the Priest or the Office?</hi> Which yet I might decline to Answer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he will not tell me, whether the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty to an Estate entailed on the <hi>Elwoods</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, be vested in the <hi>Elwood</hi> or the man? But my Friend and I agree, that it is the man qualified by the Office, in whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty is vested during his Life, and <hi>T. E.</hi> cannot fairly suppose, that by that Phrase <hi>[during Life]</hi> I intended to exclude a pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of forfeiting that right by crimes committed; for when we say a Lay-man is
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:200297:224"/> vested in an Estate during his Life, will any but a cavilling Quaker say, the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is not vested in him during Life, because he may forfeit it by crimes before he be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally dead. We are now speaking of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal right, and he that is deprived for crimes, is <hi>Mortuus in Lege.</hi> I said, <hi>The Property was vested in the Person who sustained that Office;</hi> but if he be deprived, he doth not sustain that Office, and according to my descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he loses his Property, when he is either civilly or naturally dead: But while the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son lives and continues in that Office his Property remains, and when the Person dies, or is deprived, the property is safe still, and is vested in his next legal Successor, and is not this case plain enough? 'Tis not all his ridiculous Tautologies can make any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction here. Let the Quaker go to such as sustain a Civil-Office, with Civil Rights due to them by vertue of that Office for term of Life, and ask his silly Questions of them, whether the property be vested in the Man or the Office? And how it can be vested in the Office which was endowed in times of Popery? Will any man be fooled out of his property by such trifling stuff? As to our Question, he only repeats his old untruths with a new confidence, <hi>viz. That the Office of Priest-hood was Popish when Tithes were set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled on it;</hi> and that the Office it self is now laid aside, but brings nothing new to prove this, but that which is as false as the Positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they are brought to prove: For, <hi>First,</hi>
                  <pb n="399" facs="tcp:200297:224"/>
'Tis false that <hi>Augustine</hi> ordained Bishops and Priests here by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Authority, for he received his Consecration, which gave him the power and Authority to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, from the Bishops of <hi>France. Secondly,</hi> It is false, that the Ordinations of <hi>Rome</hi> were entirely Popish in that Age, and no sober Protestant in the World will say so. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> It is also false, that the Office of Priests then was to pray for deliverance of Souls out of Purgatory, or to receive <hi>Auricular Confession,</hi> for those were Doctrines of a later stamp, as I have proved. And though the Pope, and these Opinions too (which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards prevailed) were cast off, yet it doth not at all follow that the Office was cast off; for some particular Duties of an Office may be annexed to it for a time and cast off again, and yet the Office remain still. The main duties of the Priests Office were in <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wolfe</hi>'s time, and ever since the very same, to Preach, to Pray, to Administer the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and these continuing, the Office, doubtless, continues also. If they did in the middle times Administer some of these Duties in a corrupt and Popish manner, the rectifying the manner of Administration doth not abolish the Office. The Office of our Kings, Mayors, Sheriffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> while Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery continued, had divers Popish Duties annexed to them: yet sure the Offices were not laid aside, when those Duties were laid aside; and he is fit for the fine House in <hi>Moor-Fields,</hi> who affirms so absurd a Thing:
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:200297:225"/> to conclude if the property had been vested in the Office, it had been in no danger to be lost, for when the Reformers made the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy Administer their Office better and more agreeable to Gods Word, they did not re-ordain them, nor give them any new Office, and the Quakers saucy Tongue is too long in saying the Reformation was too short herein.</p>
               <p n="13">§. 13. PAg. 397. 'Tis a certain Rule, That Quakers and Papists will recant nothing, the one to keep up the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of their Inspiration, the other of their Infallibility<note n="(b)" place="margin">Quod semel sine ratione fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cistis, ne vide amini aliquando nesci isse, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenditis; meliusque putatis non vinci quàm confessae ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere atque annuere ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritati. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nob.</hi> l. <hi>6.</hi> p. <hi>197.</hi>
                  </note>. And that is the only reason that can be given, why <hi>T. E.</hi> so stifly defends his gross mistakes with an obstinate Conscience: of which we have a plain instance in his maintaining, <hi>That the Priest hath no property in Tithes, because his Title to them lies in the gift of the Owner, nor can he remove it till the Owner have set it out.</hi> I told him before, that by this rate of Arguing, one might prove that the Husband-man had no property in the nine parts, because he cannot remove them till the Parson have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to come and take his Tenth, to which he makes no Reply: But saies, <hi>It is an odd property that a man hath to a thing he never had in Possession.</hi> Which shews how little he understands of either Law or Reason in this matter: In Law it is a Maxim, <hi>Is qui actionem habet ad rem recuperandam, ipsam rem habere videtur.</hi> F. <hi>de div. Reg. L.</hi> 15. He that hath a good Action to a thing, is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:200297:225"/> to have the thing; and a man hath a property to many things which he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver actually possessed of as yet, as the Lord in his Free-rent to be paid the next year; he had possession of the last years Rent, as the Priest had of the last years Tithe, and he hath a right to and property in this years Rent, and may dispose of it before it be come due, on condition he live so long till it become due, and so may the Priest do by this years Tithes. And the Law calls all those rights which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in things not always in our own hands, Incorporeal, and there <hi>quasi possessio,</hi> the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the right which they call <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> the liberty and right to take a thing up when it shall be, is counted <hi>possession,</hi> though we have not the things in our own keeping, <hi>Bract. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 23. §. 3, 4. <hi>Fleta l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 15. §. 16. <hi>Justin.

Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exception against the Priests property in Tithes (as frivolous as the former) is, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no certainty in Tithes:</hi> which foolish arguing would prove the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath no property in the Nine parts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no certainty in them neither,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:200297:226"/> for the Husbandman knows not whether his Crop will be much or little, but the Priest knows that his must be the Tenth part, be it more or less; and if the Husbandman have a good property before this certainty be, then so hath the Priest: And will any say <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had no property to the fifth part of the Profits of <hi>Egypt,</hi> because it was not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain how much that part would be? They have no foreheads that put their Names to such pitiful Objections. Well, <hi>but it lies in the Owners gift</hi> (he saith;) whereas Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> will teach him, <hi>That whatsoever is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully established by a Civil Title, is clearly</hi> debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum justitiae, <hi>not</hi> charitatis: <hi>Preface pag.</hi> 15. So that what the Law declares to be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers due, and compels us to set out for him, this can be no Gift of ours, no more than he that is bound by Law to pay his Quit-rent before he receive one penny of his own Rent, can be said to give that Quit-rent, and it may as well be said the Owner of the Quit-rents property or right lies in the Gift of him that pays it, since he must separate it and tender it, as that the Priests property to Tithes lies in the Gift of him that is bound by Law to separate and make it ready: And doubtless the Case of a Quit-rent, or Rent-charge, is exactly parallel to that of Tithes as to the matter now in question; both are certain parts, one of the fruits <hi>in specie,</hi> the other of the price of those fruits sold, both to be made ready by the Occupant, both ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and enjoyned by Law to be done, and
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:200297:226"/> not arbitrary as Gifts, both to be separated in the first place, both secured by sufficient penalties, and 'tis nothing to this purpose whether the penalties be the same or no (as was shewed before:) And as a Quit-rent or Rent-charge cannot be extinguished where the Law saith they are due, so neither can Tithes be extinguished where there are things titheable by Law: Nor is it a good tender of Quit-rent or Rent-charge of 10 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> to pour down an 100 <hi>l.</hi> in a gross sum, and bid the receiver please himself, no more than it is a good tender of Tithes to bid the Parson please himself out of the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits: And though the receiver of the Quit-rent or Rent-charge may not seize upon the whole hundred pounds, no, nor yet by Law take out his ten pounds, because the Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant or Owner is bound to separate it first, yet no man of Sense will deny but that he who is to receive the 10 <hi>l.</hi> hath a good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in it; for indeed this 10 <hi>l.</hi> is not the Quit-rent till the Separation, no more than the Tenth part is Tithes till Separation made; but that is only a stronger proof of the Priests and the Owner of the Quit-rents Rights; in that those who are to pay them must by such Separation own that those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions belong to another, and are none of theirs: But I fear I tire the Reader with confuting such palpable follies, only I hope the blame will be laid upon my contentious Adversary, who will not yield to the plainest truths.</p>

                  <pb n="404" facs="tcp:200297:227"/>§. 14. PAg. 400. 'Tis impossible it seems to keep a Quaker from Tautology, which is so used at their Meeting-houses, that they cannot leave it in their writings, so that now we have another stuffed skin, the old dish of the Injustice of ancient Owners granting present Profits serv'd up the third time; and as if I were obliged to write out his nauseous repetitions <hi>verbatim</hi> wherever I answer them, he blames me for the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a word, although he confesses he used that word elsewhere which I make use of here: Did he not say, <hi>it was utterly repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to reason, justice, and equity,</hi> pag. 324. <hi>most ridiculous,</hi> pag. 326. and in the very Page which I answered, <hi>pag.</hi> 338. he asks, <hi>Is any one so void of reason to imagine?</hi> And will he now say, that all this doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to the calling this Grant ridiculous and unreasonable? Or doth he repent of that saucy expression which makes Kings and Parliaments, Judges and Lawyers, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of ridiculous and unreasonable men? One might almost hope so, because this Gift which in one place is so ridiculous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, he says in other places was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>in a Religious mistake,</hi> pag. 398. and <hi>a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout mistake,</hi> pag. 410. but we know our Adversary too well to expect he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant any thing. However, if the Quakers do deny the Impropriators Right to Tithes, (as he here saith) <hi>T. E.</hi> hath done his Friends much disservice in labouring so hard as he
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:200297:227"/> did but now, <hi>pag.</hi> 383, 384, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to prove that the Impropriators have an Estate of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance and a Freehold in Tithes by the Statute Law: I thought he and his Quakers had not denied those Civil Rights which Humane Laws give to Lay-men, how inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious soever they be to the Priests. And his calling on the Impropriators to look about them when we were about to touch their Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, seems to declare, He thought we were about to take away something they had right unto, and the Hypocrisie of that is the more notorious, if he then thought as he now speaks, that they had no Right at all to them; nor would any but a double tongued and false-hearted man have exasperated them against us for affirming, much less than he here declares to be his own and the Quakers opinion.</p>
               <p n="15">§. 15. PAg. 403. Concerning Artificers paying Tithes of their gain, the Laws for them are grounded upon S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Rule, <hi>Galat.</hi> vi. 6. who when he bids every Christian give a part of his Goods, cannot be supposed to appoint less than a Tenth part, as we have proved before. And that Artificers ought to pay Tithes, is clear from the Judgment of the Fathers<note n="*" place="margin">Ambros. in Quadrag. Ser. <hi>34.</hi> Aug. de Temp. Ser. <hi>219.</hi>

This Section affords no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else considerable but the Quakers playing upon the ambiguity of the Phrases <hi>[Profits and Increase]</hi> which I used in their Latitude for all that grows or renews in a year upon a parcel of Land; but <hi>T. E.</hi> for want of better matter, doth strain them to signifie, that which we call <hi>clear Profits, and Increase after deduction of the Seed,</hi> though he himself often use the word <hi>Profits</hi> for all that comes of a Farm, as <hi>pag.</hi> 429. and elsewhere; but this quibble I shall meet with again short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, so that I will only ask him, If it be not a harder Case for Tenants to pay their full Rent (which according to him is a Third part of all that is made of the Land in a good year) even when there is no clear Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits at all, than to pay a Tenth part which is very small in a bad year? The less the Crop is, the Tithe is less, but the Rent is as great as ever.</p>

                  <pb n="407" facs="tcp:200297:228"/>§. 16. PAg. 404. If there be any method in <hi>T. E</hi>'s discourse in this Chapter, the preceeding Sections have attempted to shew that the Laws do not or ought not to give the Clergy a Civil Right to Tithes, and these that follow pretend to argue for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing of those Laws that are; but the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher admonishes in his Politicks, <hi>That it is an ill thing to be easily persuaded to change the Laws,</hi> Arist. Polit. And a great Master of Law saith, <hi>In making new Constitutions there must be apparent advantages before we recede from Laws that have long been used as just,</hi> Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian. And it was wisely ordered by that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth which decreed, <hi>That none should propound a new Law, but with a Rope about his neck, that if the motion were not approved, the Proposer might be hanged.</hi> In which posture, and under which condition, if <hi>T. E.</hi> will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his Repeal, 'tis fit he should be heard. When I shewed that the Reasons urged by <hi>T. E.</hi> for the abrogation of Tithes, would unsettle most of the old Donations to the Poor and the Endowment of Hospitals, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the Donors were Papists, and gave them for the health of their Souls, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of their Sins, if the names of Saints were annexed to their Deeds of Gift, and if they did it to maintain poor people who should come frequently to Masses, and pray for their Souls after they were dead; all these Donations, according to <hi>T. E.</hi> ought to be made void, for these were Acts which they
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:200297:229"/> did not in their Politick, but their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Capacity, not as Men but as Christians; and yet our wise Reformers did not (as he doth) think them stark nought, but pared off the Corruptions, and left the Donations firm. These then are the first sort of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions for the Poor that the Quakers argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings tend to destroy. Secondly, All Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitals endowed with Tithes, he grants, ought to be deprived of their maintenance also. But, Thirdly, He is not willing to yield that his Arguments tend to take away all provisions for the poor out of perpetual Rent-charges: But if there were any truth in his Assertions, or force in his Reasons, these must fall with Tithes also; for these are Grants of a certain part of the Profits for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, made by ancient Owners, to be raised and paid out of the present Occupants stock and the improvement thereof, to certain persons that neither do nor can do any thing for him, that can deserve such a compensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and are no otherwise abated in the Rent than Tithes are or may be: And now if those ancient Owners had nothing to do with the present Profits which are produced by the stock, care, and pains of the present Occupant, if it were ridiculous, unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and unjust for them to grant away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of those Profits beyond the time of their own Life (as <hi>T. E.</hi> argues in case of Tithes,) then those Rent-charges perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ought not to stand neither; nor will any of his pretences save his false premises from
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:200297:229"/> producing this wicked conclusion: For if an ancient Owner cannot give a certain part of the Profits <hi>in specie,</hi> he cannot give the price of them sold, the sum of money hath more trouble in raising, and doth not fall in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the small Profits of a bad year, as Tithes do, so that he that can lay on the greater burden of a certain sum out of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits sold, may surely lay on the gentler of a certain part of the Profits in kind; and if that burden descend with the Land, so doth this also; for most of these Rent-charges are secured not by power to enter on the Land, but on the stock of the present Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupant, and these were laid on by a single ancient Owner by his private Deed, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the repeated express consent of all Owners successively for divers Ages, and that consent confirmed by publick Laws, and the payment secured by as great penalties as the other; wherefore <hi>T. E.</hi> must either grant that these his arguings against Tithes are false and foolish, or else they will hold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all Rent-charges perpetual, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against these to the Poor. And finally, no provisions for them will hold, but what is set out in Lands and Tenements; so that one half of those poor, whom our Ancestor's Charity hath well provided for, must be stript of their succour, to satisfie the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers ravenous desire after Tithes. As for the Clergy, they are no Receivers of these Revenues for the Poor; they neither have, nor desire any advantage by their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:200297:230"/> So that there is no ground for his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious comparing me, or any of them, to <hi>Judas</hi> who spoiled the Poor; but <hi>T. E.</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self would do this, if his Arguments could prevail. But I will present him with a more exact Parallel by far, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Quaking Speakers vehemence against Tithes is very like to the Popish Fryars in Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> who <hi>made it a gainful Doctrine to teach Lay-men that they were not bound to pay their Tithes to their Ministers:</hi> For, as he adds a little after, <hi>By this Doctrine the</hi> Mendicants <hi>especially, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten got them to themselves (like the old</hi> Eusta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians) <hi>as Alms to be arbitrarily disposed of, to such as took any spiritual Labour; as also made their own detaining them</hi> in Lands out of which <hi>they were Parochially</hi> due, <hi>to seem the less wrongful.</hi> Seld. Hist. cap. 7. p. 166. I leave their own Consciences to make the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and only note that Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> here saith, <hi>Tithes were due out of Lands;</hi> which serves to refute a silly mistake of <hi>T. E</hi>'s in this Section, <hi>viz.</hi> That Rent-charges were due out of the Land and Tithes not so, whereas most Rent-charges have their reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for Non-payment out of the stock, and all are paid out of the Profit made of the stock, and so may as well be said to lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the stock as Tithes, which lie upon the stock no otherwise than as that stock is laid out or fed upon Land charged with Tithe. If <hi>T. E.</hi> will turn his Cattle into <hi>Chameleons,</hi> and feed them in the Air, and lay out his stock in plowing the Wind, and reaping
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:200297:230"/> the Whirlwind, I dare promise him his stock and encrease too shall be Tithe-free, and, it may be, he hath some such project, since, where we are discoursing of the encrease of a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmans stock, he saith, <hi>Encrease may be without Land,</hi> pag. 412. and if he can make out how a Husbandmans stock can encrease without Land, he knows a certain way to free himself and his Friends from Tithe, and so need not trouble our Governours to repeal the first Clause of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and the rest of the Laws for payment of them.</p>
               <p n="17">§. 17. PAg. 408. To promote his desired Repeal, he now comes to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Tithes as a grievous burden, labouring to prove in his former Book, <hi>p.</hi> 343. They are a greater burden than Rent; and if that which a man labours to prove be his own Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, then there was no occasion for him to calumniate me, as if I made this Position for him, especially since he now openly owns it, though he doth no otherwise defend it, than by a gross begging of the Question: For he takes it for granted, that Tithes are an unjust payment, which is the thing he was to prove. The case between Rent and Tithes is, that they are both just payments (which he hath granted of the one, and I have proved of the other) so that it remains a Paradox still, How the less payment can be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Burden? But if he yet think, that Rent is demanded upon more valuable considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:200297:231"/> than Tithe. I reply, that Tithe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded as an acknowledgement of God's bounty, and a sufficient Maintenance for his Ministers, stated by God's Law, as it is expounded by Primitive Fathers and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and the practice of the ancient Church; in consideration that it was given us by the Owners, possessed by our Predecessors long enough to make a good Prescription in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration that the Laws declare it to be our due, that the Owner was abated in his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase, and the Tenant in his Rent, upon the account of this so well-setled and well-known payment. And these surely are as valuable considerations as there are for demanding Rent, and make Tithes to be as just as that is, wherefore it must be the unwillingness of him that is to pay them, that makes them seem a burden, which I noted from St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi> whose name <hi>T. E.</hi> conceals. Now while the Laws of the Land, expounded by our Judges and Lawyers, declare Tithes a just due, and require the payment of them, he that calls them <hi>a great oppression,</hi> and endeavours by writing to make others think them so, he endeavours to make the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates and the Laws seem grievous, and is a seditious Libeller, and only the more impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for daring to put his name to such a Piece: Nor can he be excused from slander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole Nation, who falsly suggests that Nine parts of Ten count that (which our Laws and Magistrates declare to be a just payment,) to be <hi>a great oppression;</hi> for
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:200297:231"/> hereby he accuses the greatest part of the Nation by far, of maintaining an ill opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Governours and Laws under which they live. And experience shews the fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of this suggestion, since there is not one in twenty but pay Tithes without any compulsion, and what men do quietly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Law directs, Charity teaches us to believe they do it willingly. But the Quaker pretends, <hi>The best way to try whether the people willingly obey or no, is for our Legis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators to take away the Law.</hi> Why, what need is there of that? <hi>T. E.</hi> bragged in his Title Page, <hi>that the positive Laws were removed by his hand,</hi> but it seems he did not believe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and therefore he flatters that Authority (and calls them their Legislators) whose Power the Quakers openly despise, and most insolently boast of breaking their Laws; yet <hi>T. E.</hi> tells these Magistrates, <hi>That they have power to decide the Doubt;</hi> meaning, if they will decide it on the Quakers side, otherwise they own no such decisive power in them, as appears in their Outcries of Oppression and Persecution when these Legislators decisions are executed on them. But as to his Project of taking away the Law to try mens Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, it is one of the most foolish and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Proposals in the World: Foolish, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is grounded upon this wretched Principle, <hi>That none are free who live under any Law:</hi> by which account the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and the Precepts of the Gospel do take away the freedom of our obedience
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:200297:232"/> to God, and all the Subjects of any sort of Government regulated by Laws are Slaves: And it is pernicious also, because it advises those whose duty it is to preserve the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to destroy it: There are many who live orderly under the Laws, that would be tempted to be highly wicked, if they were removed; so that by this Act, they who are to punish Evil doers would encourage them, and invite Thieves to petition for reversing the Laws against Stealing, and Rebels for revoking those against Treason. This li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious sort of Liberty (I doubt) is the Gospel freedom this Scribler and his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers so hotly drive at; which indeed is the ready way that ill men take to overthrow the Government, which if they could get into their own hands, they would be as much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this sort of Liberty, as now they seem to be for it<note n="‖" place="margin">Ut Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferunt, si perverterint libertatem ipsi aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derentur. <hi>Tacit.

<pb n="415" facs="tcp:200297:232"/> So that the Judge (who forces this payment) is compared to a Highway-man, and the Law to a Thief's Pistol: Rare Quaking modesty!

               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 411. To return to the Proposition, <hi>That Tithes are a greater burden than Rent;</hi> Two things he said in defence of it (which he calls Reasons, though they be both Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes as great as the Proposition they would defend;) First, <hi>That the Tenant receives the worth of his Rent of his Landlord, but nothing of the Priest for his Tithes:</hi> Secondly, <hi>Rent is a voluntary contract, and he pretends Tithes are not so.</hi> To the first of these I reply, That if it were so, that the Tenant did receive nothing of the Priest for his Tithes; yet all payments to those from whom the Occupant receives nothing, are not oppressive nor unjust, as is clear from the instance I gave of an Estate charged with a payment to such poor as do nothing for the Occupant nor his Lord nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And I have already shewed, that if Ancestors can bind Heirs and Successors to any payment, they have bound them to this of Tithes, nor will I here repeat the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his repeated Mistakes; because I can prove the Tenant receives more in consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:200297:233"/> of his Tithes, than he doth in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of his Rent. For, <hi>First,</hi> he receives of his Landlord a proportionable abatement in his Rent in consideration of his Tithes, or if he doth not, he only suffers by and for his own folly, in regard he knew certainly that the Law assigned the Tenth part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to another, and therefore he should have computed whether the nine parts would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him to pay the Rent demanded, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay him for his cost and pains besides. And the low Rent of Arable Land (which pays a great Tithe) with the value of Lands legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discharged from Tithes, being higher than the same quantity of titheable Land of the same kind of Soil, doth shew that Tenants and Landlords are not unmindful of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in letting and taking Land: and this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone makes Tithe to be as just a payment as Rent. Yet, <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Quaker confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the Tenant receives more from God than he doth from his Landlord; wherefore as he makes an acknowledgment for that which he receives of the one by Rent, so he ought to do for what he receives of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Tithe, which in the opinion of wise and pious men, is an acknowledgment made for the Sun and the Rain, for our life, and health, and God's blessing on our labour, and whatever God doth toward the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the Profits: Nor is this to be evaded by pretending all is due to God, since he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly requires no more than part of all, <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat.</hi> vi. 6. and he that waits for God's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:200297:233"/> in the disposal of what he gives, may find him in his word counselling to give part of all; and if we ask what part, we are sure God liked a Tenth part once, and never shewed any dislike of that part, nor prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed any other, that part therefore is the most likely to please him. Thirdly, After all this the Tenant hath or may have (if his own obstinacy hinder not) that which is more worth than his Tithe of the Priest, Prayers, and Blessings, Sermons and Sacraments, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, Exhortation, Reproof, Comfort, Resolution of his Doubts, Direction for his Conversation, and all that which God hath made the Means of Salvation, and that by which many Souls have attained everlasting Life. And most of those that pay us Tithe do actually enjoy these things, and if some few scattered Quakers wilfully run astray, and rail at their Shepherds for inviting them back, and like the Pharisees, <hi>John</hi> ix. 40, 41. fancy they need not be taught, we have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before they ought under a settled Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to pay for Priviledges which they will not make use of; and however even these have the worth of their Tithe abated by their Landlord, and so are no losers if they pay Tithes, and are unjust if they detain them: Before I leave this I must note, That when I urged the saying of good King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Confessor, to prove, That it was just to give the Tenth part to God who gave us that and the other Nine also: He falls a railing at the times in which that King lived,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:200297:234"/> as Popish times; as if it were enough to prove every thing Popish which King <hi>Edward</hi> said, because Popery was then creeping in: This very Prince believed, <hi>That the King is God's Vicegerent,</hi> Leg. Edv. 15. <hi>That God is to be honoured above all, cap.</hi> 4. with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scripture Doctrines, and will any man in his wits be so extravagant to fancy he proves these to be Popish Doctrines, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the times were Popish times? Alas <hi>T. E.</hi> begins to low, for King <hi>Edward</hi> learned this Doctrine from St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> and St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> who lived above six hundred years before the times which the Quaker vilifies; yea, King <hi>Edward</hi> speaks not only the Sense but the very Words of those Fathers; <hi>He hath given the Nine parts, and reserved the Tenth to himself,</hi> Ambros. Serm. 34. <hi>God which vouchsafed to give us the whole, requires only the Tenth back again,</hi> Aug. Ser. 219. Had this Opinion been first invented in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s days, it had been somewhat to the purpose for <hi>T. E.</hi> to shew that Age was Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish: But since it appears that Jews and Gentiles, Patriarchs and Primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have agreed in this matter, <hi>viz. That the Tenth is the part due to God;</hi> nothing is more weak and impertinent than to attempt to prove this a Popish Doctrine by so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd a <hi>Medium.</hi>

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 416. His second pretence why Tithes are a greater burden than Rents, is because Rent is voluntary contract: But this is more than he knows; for by his own rule we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell whether men do contract or pay free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, unless the Laws were taken away which compel men to contract for Land before they enter upon it, and to pay that which they have contracted for; perhaps the Thief and his Pistol frights them to contract and pay also, and they do it no more willingly than a School-boy pulls down his Breeches; if this be a good Argument for him, it is so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and he may see the absurd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of his own discourse wounds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and makes it impossible to prove Rent a voluntary contract while the Laws stand: But to let that pass; there are thousands who do as voluntarily bargain with their Parson to give him so much Rent in a year for his Tithe as they do with their Landlord for the Land (and thus my Parishioners ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally do) so that to all these <hi>T. E</hi>'s Rule will hold, <hi>Volenti non fit injuria,</hi> and if Rent be not an oppression because 'tis voluntarily contracted for, no more are Tithes to these. And for all others that take Farms, I made it so plain, that they do either expresly or virtually contract to pay Tithes at the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of their Bargain in my 204th and 205th pages, that the Quaker only nibbles at some loose Sentences and away he flies: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall send the Reader thither for his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, where he will find it proved, that
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:200297:235"/> whoever takes a Farm which is liable to pay Tithe, doth as firmly contract to pay that Tithe to the Priest, as he doth to pay his Rent to his Landlord; and therefore upon this account Tithes are (by <hi>T.E</hi>'s own rule) no burden at all. One passage only he makes a shuffling reply to, and quarrels with my saying <hi>Tithes are a known charge upon all Land;</hi> and he pretends this was my Reason why the Tenant was supposed to contract for Tithe paying, if it were not mentioned in the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; whereas it will be as good a reason for me, if <hi>T. E.</hi> shall express it, <hi>A known charge upon the profits of all Land;</hi> for since 'tis a known Charge to arise out of either Land or Profits (no matter which) if the Tenant doth not covenant, that he will be freed of Tithe by his Landlord (as some do,) the Law justly supposes he contracted to pay it: But such holes he uses to creep out at, when he dares not stand the Argument.</p>
               <p n="18">§. 18. PAg. 418. The next absurd Position that <hi>T. E.</hi> makes use of is, <hi>That the Purchaser buys the Tithe, because he buys all that is not excepted out of the Purchase, &amp;c.</hi> Now if he could prove this, it would not do his Quakers business, who have with much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure expected the repeal of Tithes in hopes that they (who are generally Tenants) should get them to themselves, but by this unwelcome Argument, if Tithes were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, they must be given to the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:200297:235"/> who would accordingly expect and advance in Rent: And thus the poor Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers would be defeated like the <hi>Jack Daw</hi> in the Fable, which watched for the Meat the Eagle let fall, but the Fox ran away with it. But this I observe only on supposition <hi>T. E.</hi> could prove this Position, which, alas! he can never do; and it is strange boldness for one that declares he was not educated in the Law (nor doth he make it his Profession, but may likely be very defective in it, see his <hi>Page</hi> 379.) to oppose the greatest and best Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers of <hi>England</hi> in this matter, he cunningly saith I urge the <hi>Opinion of some Lawyers,</hi> (viz. <hi>That Tithes are not bought by the Purchaser of an Estate;</hi>) now these some, were two Lord Chief Justices, <hi>viz. Dyer</hi> and <hi>Coke,</hi> to which I may add <hi>Fleta,</hi> who saith, <hi>Extra patrimonium ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rò res sacrae &amp; communes, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. §. 3. All three Oracles of the Law, to whose Judgments all the Lawyers in <hi>England</hi> will readily subscribe, nor are they here speaking of the Divine, but Humane Right of Tithes, telling us that the Laws of the Nation make them a collateral Inheritance, and do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them to pass by any bargains between the Seller of an Estate and the Buyer, no not though he make over expresly all the Profits: Thus the Masters of Law speak, and what signifies one puisne Quakers Opinion to the contrary, especially when reason and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience both confute him; for Tithes as they are settled by Law are as distinct an Estate from that of the Land as any Free-rent, or
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:200297:236"/> Rent-charge; the Law hath declared they are anothers due, and therefore it will not allow one man to sell anothers Right, no not though the Seller should put the Name of Tithes into his Deed of Sale; and this Right of Tithes is such, that if the present Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent consented he cannot sell the Tithes, as <hi>Bracton</hi> observes<note n="‖" place="margin">Bracton de acquir. rer. Domin. fol. <hi>12.</hi>
                  </note>, much less can any other person sell them: The not excepting so known a Charge in a Grant of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, is no more prejudice to Tithes than the not excepting Chimney-money, Assessments, and other known Payments due by Law, is to these publick Payments: Pressed with these Arguments which he had no mind to attack directly he runs to his old Starting-hole of distinguishing between the Land and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits or Encrease, and talks as if the Buyer bought the Land and not the Profits, for the Seller, who secures the Land (as he dreams) will not secure the Profits: But he urges my saying, <hi>That Tithes are only due out of the Profits,</hi> and so thinks I claim no Tithes out of the Land, which is that the Purchaser bought according to him; this is the sum (I cannot say the substance) of this thin fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy. But first I observe, that whereas he was to prove that the Purchaser bought Tithes in his Purchase, this <hi>Jargon</hi> (if it could prove any thing) designs to prove the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That he did not buy Tithes because he bought the Land out of which <hi>T. E.</hi> will not allow Tithes to be due, but out of the Profits only which the Purchaser did
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:200297:236"/> not buy. But who can patiently hear such frivolous mistakes alledged in Argument; who knows not that he that buys the Land for ever, buys the Profits for ever, and buys it only in consideration of the Profits, and proportions the money he gives according to the Profits, and the buyer were unjust to take the Profits if he did not buy them; and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Attorneys Clerk knows that nothing is more ordinary than for the Purchaser to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and the Seller to give assurance that the Estate shall yield so much profit as 'tis valued at in the Purchase for the first seven years, yet <hi>T. E.</hi> denies this also to his shame; but whatever his ignorance may perswade him to, 'tis evident the Purchaser buys the Profits as well as the Land, only he is abated for all known Charges that are upon this Land to be paid out of the Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s, and among the rest for the Tithe, the Seller had no right to this, and so could not trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to the Buyer. The La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> had settled this on another, so that the Estate was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued at no more than the Nine parts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits were worth, no more than it would yield in clear Rent, and pay Tithes beside; and my Friend in his Vindication, <hi>pag.</hi> 320. proves by a real Case that if the Land were Tithe-free, the Purchaser must pay dearer for it, and might lett it dearer on that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration. So that we see he that purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses both Land and Profits, doth not purchase the Tithe.</p>
               <pb n="424" facs="tcp:200297:237"/>
               <p>As for his second purchase of the Profits by the Occupants stock, care, and pains, it is a meer <hi>Chimaera:</hi> For first, the Owner need not employ any stock on his Land, nor be at any pains or charge with it; for (if he made a wise bargain) he may lett it after the rate it was valued in the purchase, and so have sufficient Profits out of his Land without any further charge: But if the Occupant be a Tenant, 'tis true he hath a stock, and is at charge and pains, but it is to produce (as <hi>T. E.</hi> computes in the next Section) three times as much profit as the Rent; one part of these Profits being for his Rent, another to repay him for the charge of managing, and the third for the Tenants own use. Now how can it be said that this Tenant purchases a Crop, when that Crop pays him for all the charge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> laid out about it, and leaves him (besides his Rent paid) a considerable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of clear profits to live on or lay up. Thus the Quaker reckons when he would stretch the Tithe as high as he could, but here where it was for his interest to make the Profits seem as low as he could, he saith, <hi>That the Profits are dear enough many times of the charge laid out in procuring them:</hi> So that we see he can blow hot and cold with the same breath, and turn his story to serve his ends. But I reply, That none are free from ill accidents in any Calling; a single bad year may make the Profits dear enough of the Charge: but then Rent is not so reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a payment as he pretended but now, for
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:200297:237"/> in such a year the Tenant hath not the worth of his Rent from his Landlord: But we must speak of ordinary years, and then let it be considered, that all Meadow ground and Pasture employed in Agistment yields pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to the Occupant at very little charge: Then for Arable, the charge of Tilling and Tithe too is considered in the Rent, or else why should an Acre of Arable lett but for five shillings Rent, and an Acre of Meadow for twenty shillings, when as the Crop of the Acre of Corn is worth more than twice as much as the Crop of the Acre of Meadow: So that where the Husbandman is at much charge in procuring the Profits, he is well paid for it in that his Rent is less, and his Profits more in value; wherefore he cannot properly be said to purchase the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, in regard he is reimbursed all these char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges again by the Profits he reaps, and well rewarded for his labour and employing his stock beside: Finally, if the Tenant be a wise and considering man, he will compute his charge of managing, and advise with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self or his Neighbours, whether the Nine parts of the whole Profits, <hi>communibus annis,</hi> may be likely to repay him for his charge and labour, and to enable him to pay his Rent, and yield some clear Profits, otherwise he will not meddle, for he knows that the Law gives the Tenth to another, and that must (in Lands titheable) be as certainly paid to the Parson as his Rent to the Landlord: From whence it appears, that the Tenant
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:200297:238"/> doth not purchase the Profits, but only lays down his money for a while, and receives it again with advantage; and it is his own fault if he be not considered for all he lays out in procuring the Nine parts, and for the Tenth also: And his Rent is, or may be so stated (if he act wisely) that he may be well paid for his charge in making ready the Parsons Tenth as well as his own Nine parts: So that neither the Landlord nor Tenant can be said to purchase Tithes, the one being abated in his Purchase, the other in his Rent, for that known interest which the Law gives the Parson in the Profits of the Land so bought or farmed.</p>

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 421. Although he laboured but now to prove the Impropriator had a Freehold in Tithes, yet now he hath the confidence to say, <hi>That he that sells an Estate, the Tithes of which are Impropriate and belong to a third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, sells that third persons right without making him party to the Sale, or giving him any of the purchase money:</hi> A strange assertion! That one man can sell anothers Freehold, and out him of it without his knowledge or consent, is the direct consequence of this monstrous Position. But to leave him to the just scorn of all that understand Law or Reason, I shall note, That the Laws do not permit him that sells his own Estate to sell anothers; and that it appears by this instance, That the Law reckons Tithes as a distinct estate from that of the Land: And good reason; for the
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:200297:238"/> Owner of the Land (in this case) never pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased nor possessed the Tithes, and he can convey no more right to the Seller than he had in himself by <hi>T. E</hi>'s own Maxim; yea, and by those very words of the Deed of Sale (part of which the Quaker fraudulently left out on purpose to conceal the cheat he had put upon his Reader) <hi>All the Estate, Right, Title, Interest, Property, Claim, and Demand whatsoever, which I the said</hi> A. <hi>have or ought to have in the Premisses:</hi> which very plainly declare that the Seller doth not sell the Tithe, for by the Law he had no Estate, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, nor Property in the Tithe, no Right nor Title to it, nor could he make any claim or demand of it: But the Estate, Right, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, Interest, and Property was in another, who with his Predecessors had claimed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, received, possessed and enjoyed them many years. And if he take it to be no Argument of my Depth to suggest this, I am sure it is an argument of his dissimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to conceal it, from those shallow Readers his obvious Fallacies are calculated for; and if he had not forgot the A B C, and first Principles of Honesty, he could not have been guilty of such gross collusion. In his first Book, <hi>the Purchaser purchased all that was not excepted out of the Purchase, and Tithes were not excepted;</hi> so that it seems the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaser bought Tithes: And yet here <hi>the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupant purchased them too with his labour, and cost, and stock,</hi> and he reels about not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where to fix, for as the Jews say, <hi>A lye
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:200297:239"/> hath no feet:</hi> and indeed neither of them purchased them as I have now made appear. The rest of this Section is spent in stusfing the skin of that baffled distinction of the Land and the Profits: But as for the false consequences he draws from such fallacious premisses, I shall only tell him, That a man may buy an Estate, and have a right to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry foot of Land in that Estate, and yet not have right to all the Profits, if some ancient Owner have left it under a Quit-rent or Rent-charge, then this part of the Profits is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come long since the estate of another person collateral to the estate of the Land, and did not belong to the Seller, nor was it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the Buyer. And it is most absurd for him to say, <hi>That Rent-charges are laid on the Land, and paid out of the Rent of the Land without regard to the encrease that is made:</hi> For is not the Rent it self, out of which the Rent-charge is paid, a part of the encrease? And if no regard be had to the encrease, the Rent-charge might as well have been laid on a waste and barren Heath that yields no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit as on a good Farm, for that is Land as well as this; I wish <hi>T. E.</hi> would put his own Rule in practice, and lend 100 <hi>l.</hi> for a Rent-charge of six pound <hi>per Annum,</hi> and lay it on Lands not yielding Profits above the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of three pound <hi>per Annum:</hi> And if he say, that will not pay him his six pound <hi>per Annum,</hi> I must tell him, that by his own rule he must have no regard to the encrease, if his Rent-charge be laid on Land it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:200297:239"/> Finally, both Tithe and Rent-charges are charged upon Land, but to be paid out of the Profits, both laid on by anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Owners, both obliging all that succeed, only one is laid on the Land, by the Publick Laws, the other by private Contract, so that one may be known without a particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, the other could not, and that is the true reason why Rent-charges are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly excepted sometimes, but Tithes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and not (as <hi>T. E.</hi> falsly suggests) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Rent-charges are charged on the Land only, and Tithes on the Profits; for the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasers Land is the less worth for the Charge of Tithes upon it, as well as it would be for a Rent-charge of the same proportion: And now I leave it to the Reader to judge what Character and Epithetes the Quaker deserves for the follies and falshoods, the equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and contradictions of this Section.</p>

After all his out-cries of Tithes being an oppression upon the Tenants, and pretences of their purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Tenth part of the Profits as well as the Nine; He dares not positively say, that they are not abated of their Rent in conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their Tithes they pay, only he sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests <hi>'tis questionable;</hi> but since experience shews, That a Close or Farm will certainly lett dearer for being Tithe-free, and give less Rent if the Tenant must pay Tithe, it is unquestionable to every man else that Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:200297:240"/> really are abated in consideration of Tithes: Yea, I know divers peaceable Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, but will not tell <hi>T.

By all which it appears that the Parsons distinct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest is considered between Landlord and Tenant: If the Landlord receives a Rent proportionable to the whole Profits, the Tenth part as well as the Nine, then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Parsons right as well as his own, and then the Landlord must pay him, if he receive only in proportion to the nine parts, then the Tenant must pay the Parsons rights; for he pays less Rent in consideration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: This plain and known Truth <hi>T. E.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairs of being able to confute, and therefore hopes to escape by making a great bustle, as if my Friend and I contradicted one another, in our reply to his Supposition, whereby he pretended to demonstrate that if there were an Abatement made, it was not proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to the Tithe; but he is forced to leave out some of my Friends words, and alter my sense, to make somewhat look like a contradiction where there was none. He supposes a Farm worth 100 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 90 <hi>l.</hi> rent, 10 <hi>l.</hi> being abated only for Tithe, whenas the whole Profits he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses worth 270 <hi>l.</hi> and the Tithe 27 <hi>l.</hi> my Friend replies, that <hi>A farm of that value con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in Tillage may be worth</hi> 27 <hi>l. per Annum</hi>
                  <pb n="430" facs="tcp:200297:240"/> (there <hi>T. E.</hi> breaks off, but my Friend adds) <hi>or a farm of that value consisting in Pasturage may not yield seven shillings a year to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:</hi> So that my Friend counts it only possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble such a thing may rarely happen where a a Farm consists only of Tillage, that the Parson may receive 27 <hi>l.</hi> for Tithe out of a Farm of 90 <hi>l. per Annum:</hi> But I thought it seldom did actually happen, and therefore asked, <hi>What Parson did ever receive</hi> 27 <hi>l. per Annum for a Farm of</hi> 90 <hi>l. Rent?</hi> I am sure I never knew such an Instance, there being scarce any Farms consisting only in Arable, yet I do not say it was impossible, and so do not contradict my Friend; for indeed we both agree in the main, that <hi>T. E</hi>'s fallacy lies, in not expressing whether this Farm were Tillage or Pasture; of the latter 'tis evidently false; of the former it may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times possibly be true, yet Rules are not to be drawn from things that rarely happen; now taking Church-livings together, I do not think the Parsons get above 10 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> for a 90 <hi>l.</hi> Farm, or about that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion one with another. I excepted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those Livings <hi>where there was much Corn, pag.</hi> 213. but coosidering that there is far more Grounds converted to Meadow and Pasture, than employed in Tillage, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of those yield less than two shillings in the pound rent, though this produce more; to which if we add also customs and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, exemptions and the ill payments of Quakers and dishonest persons (whom I
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:200297:241"/> would charitably suppose not to be above one part of twenty) it will follow that Farms [taken one with another] do not yield above two shillings in the pound rent for Tithe, and I gave a real and evident proof of this in a Parish mixed of Tillage and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture which yields not 80 <hi>l.</hi> out of 1000 <hi>per Annum;</hi> and both my Friend and all other Men who understand this matter are satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, the Parsons throughout all <hi>England</hi> have not above two shillings Tithe for one pound rent; so that if the Landlord do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate 10 <hi>l.</hi> in 100 <hi>l.</hi> he abates as much as the Tithe generally comes to, and the Tenant is as fully considered for paying Tithe, as he is for paying a Rent-charge; and if he were not to pay this Ten pound to the Parson, he must pay so much more to his Landlord (supposing the Farm Tithe-free.) Nor is it possible for <hi>T. E.</hi> to excuse his Quakers from notorious dishonesty who have Ten pound abated (at least) yet will pay nothing for Tithe. He saith, <hi>The Quakers do not desire to reap the benefit of other mens Lands for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, pag.</hi> 417. But in this Case the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker hath Ten pounds worth of Land for which he pays nothing to either Priest or Landlord, no not though his Landlord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate it in consideration of the Priests right: This is Quakers honesty! <hi>T. E.</hi> noted before that Rent was no oppression, because they had the worth of it of their Landlord, and by the same rule, Tithe is no oppression, for they have the worth of it also from their
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:200297:241"/> Landlord. But if this 90 <hi>l.</hi> Farm consist much of Tillage, and pay more than ten pounds for Tithe, the Tenant ought to have considered what publick payments were like to be paid out of his Farm besides his Rent; as, Tithe, Assessments, Quit-rents, &amp;c. and should have stood on a proportionable abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and if he did not, he pays for his own folly, and deserves no pity. My Friend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed instances in a Farm of 30 <hi>l.</hi> rent, whose Tithe was valued at 5 <hi>l.</hi> (which is short of <hi>T. E</hi>'s supposition of 27 <hi>l.</hi> Tithe for 90 <hi>l.</hi> rent) and I never denied but some particular Farms yield more Tithe than two shillings in the pound (as also some yield less;) but this instance of my Friends shews, that a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaser must pay dearer for a Farm Tithe-free, and that a Tenant who pays no Tithe to the Parson, is nothing eased thereby, for he pays so much more Rent to his Landlord, which overthrows all <hi>T. E</hi>'s airy Castles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Landlords purchasing Tithes, and the Tenants paying it out of his own Stock, &amp;c. and finally, the Quaker-tenant who detains Tithes, either was a Fool not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a proportionable abatement for his Tithe, (and why should the Priest suffer for the Quakers folly?) or he is a Knave if he had an abatement made, because this pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was to go out of his Farm, and will not pay it for all that: The Light of Nature and Moral Honesty taught Heathens better things.</p>

                  <pb n="434" facs="tcp:200297:242"/>§. 20. PAg. 431. This Section is chiefly spent in making out some seeming contradiction in the Discourses of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, the better to evade his own real contradicting of himself; but they are so manifest an abuse of our words and sense, that whosoever reads our Books as well as his, will easily see they deserve no reply. Since I said, <hi>Few Landlords do allow so much as two parts of three to the Tenants:</hi> that suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses I did believe, that some Landlords might allow so much, and that is all which can be deduced from my Friends supposing that <hi>a Farm may be worth three times the Rent.</hi> He thinks it possible; and I say, <hi>I fear there are few such Landlords:</hi> But I never said, <hi>there were no such Landlords,</hi> and so do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict my Friend: No, nor my self, when I say in one place, <hi>Few Priests get so much as a full Tenth part of all manner of Profits:</hi> And in another, <hi>That the People generally pay their Tithes as freely as any other dues:</hi> For the full Tenth of all manner of Profits is not by the Laws now in force appointed to be paid to the Priest. He forgets how little profit (he himself said) the Priest could require, from grounds stocked with Horses, and Wood suffered to grow to Timber, yet in many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes great Profits are raised by these to the Owners: He forgets my Friends assertion, that a farm of 90 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> consisting in Pasturage, may not be worth seven shillings <hi>per Annum</hi> to the Parson; nor doth he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:200297:242"/> how little Profits the Priests have of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Cole-pits, Lead-mines, Allum-works, with other rich Manufactures that bring in large Revenues to the Owners and Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pants: And finally, if we add Customs and Compositions, which take off a huge pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the full Tenth of all Profits, and yet are allowed by Law; We shall easily see, that though the People do pay all the Tithes which the Law obliges them to pay, very free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet there are few Priests who will get the Tenth part of all manner of Profits, yea, though there were not a Knave nor a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker in all <hi>England.</hi> His Argument therefore halts still on both sides, and these imaginary Crutches will not support it. Again, 'tis very true that some wickedly call Relief to the Poor, Oppression, that is, those Assess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are now laid on by the present Laws: But none ever said that it was Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression to pay a sum of money given out of an Estate to the Poor, though there be no particular compensation allotted for raising and paying it: When <hi>T. E.</hi> can make the present Assessments to the Poor, and old Donations of Rent-charges settled on the Poor to be all one thing, then he will find a contradiction here. And as to his pretence, that the Tenant is satisfied for his pains in raising the Rent-charge, as he is for the rest of his Rent, I reply so is he also for raising his Tithe; the Landlord and Tenant at the Bargain making either did or are supposed to know, that the Tithe made ready was (by
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:200297:243"/> the Laws of the Land) the interest of a third person, and therefore if the Tenant were wise, and the Landlord just, the Rent was so adjusted, that the Tenant might afford to discharge that interest which the Law secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Parson, as well as that which the Law secured to the Landlord (and I have shewed the Rent is therefore considerably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated in Arable Land especially) so that the Tenant hath the same satisfaction from his Crop for making Tithe ready, as he hath for the other parts: And yet besides, the Law makes the Occupant some allowance for raising his Tithe, in that all Cattle used for the Plough, or bred for the Pail, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to Pasture Tithe-free, nor hath the Priest any part in the eatage of Meadows af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Crop of Hay be taken: And this is some allowance out of the Tenth part of the Profits towards the charge of making ready. Moreover, as the Tenant is obliged by Law to pay a certain proportion of his Profits, so is the Priest also obliged to preach and pray publickly and ordinarily one day in seven, besides many other times on extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary occasions; and these Sermons are not like the Quakers harrangues, <hi>Quicquid in buccam venerit,</hi> but made ready with great pains; the Priest employing his stock of Books and Learning, and his Talents of Grace received of God also, in the composing of them, and all good Protestants have the benefit of our stock and pains as much as we of theirs. But if they be Quakers or Papists,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:200297:243"/> yet we make our Sermons ready for them, and by Toll of a Bell give them notice to come and take their part if they please. Let them therefore make their Tithe as ready for us, as we do our Sermons for them, and give us as good notice when that is ready, as we do when these are ready, and then if we (by our own default) come not to take our part, we will never blame them, much less sue them: For howsoever he accuses the Clergy of Cruelty in suing for Tithes, I am sure 'tis a Cruelty in those who force us so to do, where the Law is clear, and the Due so evident; and 'tis always a fourth damage to the Parson to prosecute the very Statute of treble damages. Nor did I ever know a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Priest but had much rather receive his Tithe quietly, than have the advantage of the Statute, with the trouble and charge of prosecution: Wherefore the Quakers are cruel to themselves, who know the mischiefs of refusing to pay, yet much against the Priests minds, wilfully run into them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 434. If <hi>T. E.</hi> be still ignorant of the reason why Tithe should be paid without deduction for the Charge of making it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it is because none are so blind as they that will not see: For supposing nothing had been abated by the Landlord in Rent, nor nothing taken out of the Tenth part of the Profits to make satisfaction for raising Tithes, yet it is a reason sufficient why the Priest should not compensate for it out of his
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:200297:244"/> Tithes, in that the ancient Owners who gave and settled Tithes, ordered them to be paid intire without any such deduction, even as the Donors of Rent-charges to the Poor also do. And for their granting Tithes thus made ready, there was a good reason, <hi>viz.</hi> because the Priests might not be forced to labour themselves, lest thereby their attendance on Spiritual Ministries should be hindered: <hi>That they may so much the more diligently pour out Prayers to God for us,</hi> saith our Charter: For which reason (as <hi>Philo</hi> notes) God gave the Levites Tithes without their own making them ready. The same also is <hi>Origen</hi>'s rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why Gospel Ministers should have Tithes prepared by the People: And the Council of <hi>Mascon</hi> fully expresseth it, <hi>That being hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by no labour about unlawful things, they might have more leisure to attend Divine admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations.</hi> Seld. pag. 58. Our Ancestors considered that God had enjoyned the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy wholly to attend the work of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 15. and liked not their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangling themselves in the Affairs of this life, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 4. and the Ecclesiastical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons fordid it; <hi>Apostol. Can.</hi> 6. <hi>Concil. Ellib. Can.</hi> 19. <hi>Concil.</hi> 1. <hi>Carthag. Can.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp; Can.</hi> 9. <hi>Concil. Chalced. Can.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that in order to the enabling the Clergy to observe this part of God's revealed Will, and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Law grounded thereon, they did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point their Maintenance should be made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to their hands, and paid entire. And that instance of <hi>David</hi>'s Law about the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:200297:244"/> of Spoils, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxx. 25. shews, They might not only do it for their own time, but bind their Posterity to do it after them; for that Law of <hi>David</hi> not only stood during his time, but <hi>from that day forward he made it a Statute and Ordinance for</hi> Israel <hi>unto this day;</hi> (saith the holy Text:) And <hi>Josephus</hi> affirms it was observed among his Posterity. <hi>Jos. Antiq. l.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. Now if <hi>David</hi> could make a Law to oblige his Posterity in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposing of Spoils taken long after his own time, to the taking of which he contributed nothing: Much more might <hi>Ethelwolf,</hi> and all his Subjects, bind their Posterity in the disposing of the Profits of those Lands which they left them to raise the whole Profits out of. Besides, our Ancestors followed God's example in appointing Tithes to be paid without deduction for the Charge of raising them; for He did appoint so in the Case of the Levites, to whose Cities and Store-houses, or else to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the Jews car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them <hi>gratis,</hi> and paid them there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire: Now God cannot be the Author of an unjust thing. And for <hi>T. E</hi>'s poor shifts, it signifies nothing to say, <hi>It was not unjust in</hi> Canaan <hi>because it was fruitfuller than our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey:</hi> For if our Land be less fruitful, it yields less Tithe, which is mowed and reaped with less Charge: And it is as frivolous to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <hi>it was not unjust under that Polity;</hi> for that which is an Oppression in it self, is so under all Polities. But his saying <hi>Tithes were then an exchange for Land,</hi> is a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:200297:245"/> falshood; for if we compute their 48 Cities with their Suburbs, and compare them with the breadth and length of <hi>Canaan,</hi> it will appear they had (besides their Tithes) a bigger proportion of Land (though it lay dispersed) than any other Tribe had: Nor yet doth he know that <hi>Canaan</hi> was managed with half the Charge of our Land, though he boldly asserts this which he cannot prove; and yet if it were so, it is to be considered that the Jews were at the charge of Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of their Tithes made ready, either to the Levites Cities or <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which was sometimes a long way from them, and from this Charge our People are free; and yet in so fruitful a Land, and so large quantities of Tithe, the Carriage alone would be greater than one half of the Charge that our People are at in all: And this will make it as easie here as it was there. So that his pretended difference between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Canaan</hi> is grounded on miserable mistakes; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is forced to beg the old Question, and affirm, <hi>God doth not require us to pay Tithes without deduction here, as he did there:</hi> But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving proved the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of Tithes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I will not repeat those Arguments; only he may note that every thing is not an oppression nor unjust which is not required by an express Law of God: if the Laws of the Land require this payment without the Priests pains or charge for wise, pious, and good reasons, taken from God's example in a like case, and inferred by necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:200297:245"/> from his Laws in the N. Testament; that secures the thing from being an oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and makes him that calls it so a Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer.</p>

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 437. Finally, though I did prove it was not needful any compensation should be made by the Priest for raising Tithes, yet I did before shew, how some ingenious persons thought that God made a compensation: But I did not throw this Pearl before <hi>T. E.</hi> I knew he that did not value Christ's <hi>ipse dixit,</hi> but was so impious to say to our Saviour's words, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxiii. 3. —<hi>Nay, Hold there,</hi> &amp;c. (in his first Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 20.) He would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly slight S. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s <hi>ipse dixit,</hi> and he that despised the Master, was like to contemn his Servants. The prospect of which made me turn away from him in my former Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 217. and say, <hi>To let him alone I will tell more sober men:</hi> and such do understand both S. <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Spelman</hi> to be above his scorn, and their sayings to be no less rational, for the contempt which <hi>T.E.</hi> pours on them. <hi>The Earth and the fulness thereof</hi> (that is, the Land and all the Profits) <hi>are the Lords, and of him we receive them both:</hi> How then can it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable for us to make ready the Tenth part of these Profits for him without dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, who gives us the other Nine, and is willing we should enjoy them? And on this condition we give him the Tenth only, he requires no bigger part, and is it not very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable he should have that made ready? This
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:200297:246"/> is S. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s way of computing the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmans compensation. And for Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi>'s, I proposed it to the ingenious as a different way, and so no wonder if it be not the very same, yet is it also rational enough; That of our Time (which God gives us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our pains) he should have a larger pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, but of our Profits (which come by his blessing on our Labours) a lesser: a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth of that; and but a Tenth of these, to compensate our Pains in making them ready. And though Quakers and Atheists despise these arguings, it is enough to my purpose if the Sober part of men who own Providence do think any of these ways a sufficient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation: For if any of them be approved by such as are fit and impartial Judges, then it is no injustice to require Tithes without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, God's bounty and his blessing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve such a proportion intire: The Ministers pains do fully answer it, and his profession as well as his duty requires it. The Law hath made abatements to the Occupant in conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his charge and pains in preparing the Tenth, and so hath the Landlord also: And though the Quaker study to make the Priests as odious as he can, yet he can never make it heavier to pay a Tenth part of that which God sends in a bad year, than to pay a full Rent in such a year; which is (as he reckons) the third part of the whole Profits in a good year; if there be a manifest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease there is very little Tithe; that decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses also, but the Rent is as big as ever. And
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:200297:246"/> though the Priest take as much spiritual pains in a bad year as a good one, he is content with a lesser quantity of Tithe, yea, and often to my own knowledge, forgives all or part of his dues, to such Parishioners whose poverty or losses plead for it. Nor can it be an injury to the Tenant in a bad year to pay Tithes; for (since he was allowed in his Rent after the proportion of a good year) he doth not pay so much in such a year as he was allowed in consideration of his Tithe. The Priest is pleased with his Tithes in kind, if they be worth but twenty shillings, and yet it may be the Landlord allowed the Tenant five pound upon that account: And put the case in a bad year the Tenant by Covenant be to be free from paying Tithe, to be sure he hath a Tenth part more Rent to pay for that privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge at least, which (in such a year) may be more than his Tithe in kind is worth; and then 'tis plain that he who is Tithe-free in a bad year, and a decreasing Crop, is the greater loser. Hence it is that the all-wise God, and our judicious Ancestors following his Example, ordered that Tithe should be paid in kind, that it might rise and fall with the Crop, and with the Husbandmans ability: And since the Parsons livelyhood and the Countrymans is deposited in one bottom, this justly makes the Clergy sensible of their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and losses, and engages his Prayers for the averting Droughts and Deluges, Blasting and Mildews, &amp;c. which will hurt his Tenth part as well as their Nine. But <hi>T. E.</hi> dares
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:200297:247"/> call that foolish and unjust, which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and the wisest and best of men, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended as prudent and full of Equity.</p>
               <p n="21">§. 21. PAg. 441. There was enough said before to convince any man of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>That Tithe was easier to us Christians now than it was to the Jews of old:</hi> but <hi>T. E.</hi> is by his self-conceit made incapable of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending when he is confuted, and therefore he stands to his old mistake, not caring to fall foul upon his great Master, <hi>Selden,</hi> and his divine <hi>Scaliger,</hi> from whose <hi>Diatriba</hi> I took this computation (though I sent this Quaker to <hi>Goodwin</hi> for it at the second hand, because he had it by him) and though the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count be approved in Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s History of Tithes, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 17. the Quaker resolves to confute it, but 'tis with an Argument that leans on nothing but falshood and fallacy: For he fancies we are all mistaken in that we do not deduct the Seed sown (out of which the Profits came) before the Tithing; when as all that understand the Jews practice know, they separated their Tithe in the first place, before any such deduction of the Seed. As for the Text which he cites out of <hi>Deut.</hi> xiv. 22. it doth not belong to this first or Levites Tithe spent in Feasts, as his own Author will tell him, <hi>Seld. Hist. Tithes, chap.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 13. <hi>&amp; Junius &amp; Trem. not. in Deut.</hi> xiv.

<pb n="445" facs="tcp:200297:247"/> &amp;c.</hi> from whence he confirms his Argument, it is only the ambiguity of the English word <hi>[Increase]</hi> which gives colour to his false in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; for though in English the Increase of the Seed, may be strained to signifie, That which is over and above the seed sown, yet there is not the least foundation in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal for such a Cavil; for in the Hebrew it is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally thus, <hi>All that cometh of thy Seed:</hi> and <hi>Buxtorf</hi> out of <hi>Maimonides</hi> and others, saith, the word signifieth <hi>The product of the next year; Jun. &amp; Trem.

All which plainly imply the whole Crop was to be tithed without any deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And the English Version used the word <hi>[Increase]</hi> in the same sense, for all that grows in one year. This Cobweb therefore was to catch Quakers who could not search the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal, and he was, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> speaks of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>'s Orators, <hi>secure, because of the credulity and easiness of their Auditory:</hi> But to men of Learning 'tis a ridiculous Cavil, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Account remains firm, nor was the Seed to be deducted before Tithing among the Jews: And unless (as <hi>Seneca</hi> saith of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so) he count it better to be pertinacious than to be penitent, T.E.</hi> must recant this foolish Error. Secondly, That which was paid as a Tithe to the Poor, the Widow, and the Fatherless, was never taken out of the first or Levites Tithe, no, nor yet out of the second Tithe for Feasts at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as seems very plain
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:200297:248"/> from that place of <hi>Tobit</hi> (which is good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for a Jewish Custom) where he saith, <hi>He paid his first and second Tithe every year, and yet added a third Tithe for the poor every Third year, Tobit.</hi> 1.7, 8. And <hi>Josephus</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly saith, <hi>Besides the two Tithes which every year you are commanded to pay, one to the Levits, another to the Feasts at</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>there is a third Tithe every third year to be given to the Widow, the Poor, and the Fatherless;</hi> Joseph. Ant. l. 4. cap. 17. And this extraordinary Tithe superadded to the other two, made this Third year to be called, <hi>The year of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, Deut.</hi> xxvi. 12. Nor is it likely that the Feasts at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> were neglected every third year, or could be maintained without their usual allowance, which they could not have, if the Tithes which furnished them had been given to the Poor every third year; and though Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> be of a contrary opinion, yet 'tis made plain he cites the Rabbins wrong, and is grosly mistaken in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: see <hi>Nettles confut. of the Jewish part of Mr.</hi> Seld. <hi>Hist. of Tithes, pag.</hi> 78. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Jewish Husbandman raised a stock for the Poor, as well as the Christian, and that beside his Tithes. But admit the second Tithe for Feasts had been taken out every third year as a stock for the Poor, yet still the Jews paid far more than the Christians do: Every year the First-fruits, <hi>viz.</hi> a fourtieth, fiftieth, or sixtieth part (now not paid at all) and also a full Tenth of the whole Profits, without any <hi>Modus,</hi> Custom, or Compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:200297:248"/> (which now considerably lessen the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Tithes) and for two years together, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Tithe out of the tithed Nine parts (now never required) for Feasts: So that in these two years a Jew paid far more than a Christian, and even in the third year (set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aside the Poors Tithe) they paid a fuller Tithe than Christians pay, and First-fruits beside: But <hi>T. E.</hi> shall see it in his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a Farm of 90 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> where he reckons largely for the Christian.</p>
               <p>The full Profits (according to <hi>T. E.</hi>) of 90 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> in three years are 810 <hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of this the Christian pays to the Priest besides what he pays to the Poor (according to <hi>T. E.</hi>) the sum of 81 <hi>l.</hi> for his Tithe.</p>

                  </gap>ve also they paid not only the Tithe of Cattle as we do, but also the first Calf of every Cow, the first Lamb of every Ewe, &amp;c. which was over and above the Tenth, and would come to near as much more; neither had they any Customs or Compositions to diminish their Tithe as we have; for if they commuted their Tithe into money, they were to add a fifth part more, <hi>Lev.</hi> xxvii. 31. for fear they should not give the full worth of the Tithe; yet he
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:200297:249"/> hath still the boldness to say Tithe is a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier burden on us than on the Jews. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He doth not know what charge the Jews managed their Land with; there were bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren as well as fruitful parts in <hi>Judaea,</hi> but the same Law of Tithing by God's order stood for all kinds of Land; and the difference of increase between their Land and ours is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpose, because their larger Crops pay larger Tithe, and our lesser Crops pay less; and though their Land was of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent fruitfulness, yet all paid the tenth, and they had bad years as well as we, but still the proportion was a tenth; and if it were just to order it so then, it remains to be a just thing still. St. <hi>Hierom</hi> calls it <hi>A wicked sort of Discourse to draw the Scripture to our Opinion against its will;</hi> and yet so <hi>T. E.</hi> Discourses here, when he abuses that place <hi>of the Levites having no part with the other Tribes</hi> (i. e. no intire Country together) to disprove that, which the Scripture plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirms, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Levites</hi> had Cities of their own. <hi>Adrichomius</hi> reckons up Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty of them by name. <hi>Descr. Ter. Sanct. p.</hi> 58. Nor are all our Glebes and Parso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage-houses in <hi>England,</hi> so great a part of this Country (which is much the larger) as those Cities (which Scripture mentions) were of the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And if the Priests here have temporal Inheritances, it is because they descend from all sorts of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies with us, and not from one <hi>Tribe,</hi> and their Sons are often Lay-men (as many of
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:200297:250"/> their Fathers were) and then their Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances return among the People again; nor can it be an injury to any man in <hi>England,</hi> that I (who only have the right to it) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy my own Patrimony; or who can justly say they have less, because I have my own? The Riches of our greater Clergy have been from very old Donations, and many of those Donations made by the Clergy themselves: Nor are they higher or richer than those of the <hi>Levitical Priesthood</hi> were; the High-Priest then was the next man to the King, and the <hi>Levites</hi> (for the most part) were the Judges; and <hi>Philo</hi> in that Book of <hi>The Rewards and Honour of the Priesthood,</hi> saith, <hi>That Priest which had least might be accounted very Rich</hi>—And again, <hi>By their Revenues it appears that the Law intended to make them Equal to Princes in Majesty and Honour— for they abounded not only in necessaries, but also in all that was curious and delicate:</hi> thus <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> who very well knew the state of the Jewish Priests; as also did <hi>Josephus,</hi> who tells us that there were one hundred and twenty thousand of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Order in his time, yet none of them wanted a good Provision; whereas there are not much more than ten or twelve thousand in <hi>England.</hi> And surely it is a strange Paradox that it should be a greater burden for <hi>England</hi> (which is so very much bigger than <hi>Canaan</hi>) to maintain twelve thousand Clergy-men with a lower Maintenance, than it was for <hi>Canaan</hi> to maintain above ten times as many,
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:200297:250"/> with a more plentiful allowance. Their Tithes were more than ours, and so were their Offerings also in that populous and (as <hi>T. E.</hi> saith) fruitful Country, as I shewed in my first Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 221. And for Deductions also, they had none that were considerable, in respect of what we have now, so that he had little need to require the Priest to pay the Clerk and Sexton for doing the Parishes work for them, since he hath not so much as a <hi>Levitical</hi> Priest had. Thus <hi>T. E</hi>'s notorious untruth is detected, and all his ignorance and mistakes laid open in this matter, so that I conclude with St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s saying to <hi>Cresconius, What need was there, I pray, when you had undertaken to defend a rash falshood, to raise such clouds of darkness as might obscure the most manifest Truth?</hi> Aug. <hi>Cresc.</hi> His flying to such Sconses is a sign of a bad baffled Cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 448. The rest of this Discourse is a continuation of like mistakes, for Tithes were not introduced into this Nation at first under pretence of Alms for the Lay-poor. King <hi>Ethelwolfe</hi> himself, who gave Tithes to the Church, made another Donation to the Poor. <hi>Spelm.</hi> Concil. T. 1. p. 352. and not only St. <hi>Augustine</hi> but our <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws declare, that besides Tithe to the Priest, Alms is to be given out of the nine parts to the Poor, as was shewed before; nor was it <hi>the Tithes of Parish Priests</hi> (the Subject of our Discourse) out of which the Statutes
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:200297:251"/> cited by <hi>T. E.</hi> order a provision for the poor, but the Tithes of Churches Appropriate, and to apply this to the Tithes paid to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Priests, is an evident fraud, and may be discovered by consulting those Statutes, 15 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2.6. And 4 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Thorp</hi> indeed calls Tithes the <hi>Parish Goods;</hi> But he brings not one word of Common or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Law to prove they are so, and doth <hi>T. E.</hi> think <hi>Thorp</hi>'s <hi>ipse dixit</hi> will pass with me? The Clergy indeed while they enjoyed all the Tithes were so bountiful of their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity (not by human Laws compelling) that they were the only Overseers of the Poor, and would be so again if they had their Rights intire. As for the injunctions of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> they only require Non-resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents to give the Fortieth part of their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the Poor, and I know divers of them who give much more, nor can they be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused from impiety and ingratitude, who do not voluntarily give as much as is there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired: And if <hi>T. E.</hi> and others will pay their Tithes exactly according to one of those injunctions, <hi>viz.</hi> the Fifteenth, I will assure him the Clergy shall observe whatever is there enjoyned to them, and 'tis but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable <hi>T. E.</hi> should obey that which he makes a rule for others. Were Tithes of all the profits in <hi>England</hi> now fully paid to the Clergy, they might undertake to give to the Poor as good an Allowance as the Laiety now give them; but alas in many places they have by Impropriations, Compositions, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes,
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:200297:251"/> Exemptions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> their Tithes so much impaired, as there is scarce enough left for themselves; yet as it is (if envy will let men speak truth) it must be confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that the Clergy generally give more to the Poor than any sort of men in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who have no better Estates than they have. To conclude therefore, Tithes were rightly given to Ministers, and are settled on them by good Laws, and are an equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble payment, not really burdensome to any, far less than what God allotted the Jewish Priests, and are now employed for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining those that perform Divine Offices, and of what can be spared from thence, the Poor are Relieved: and therefore there is no reason to Repeal the Laws that enjoyn them.</p>
               <p n="22">§. 22. PAg. 451. We have now done with the main Question, and seen by what evident falshood and poor fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacies <hi>T.

'Tis evident then that the Apostles first began to fix the Clergy: and my Friend and I both agree that the Apostles themselves, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed, and so could not receive Tithes, but they began to fix others unto whom (as soon and as oft as the times and state of the Church permitted) First-fruits and Tithes were paid: And what contradiction is there in this?

As to the <hi>Saxons, T.

<pb n="458" facs="tcp:200297:254"/> these are called <hi>Vagabond Clergy,</hi> in St. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick</hi>'s Synod, <hi>An.</hi> 456. and were not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after the settling of the Church, which is a manifest proof of the early fixing of the Clergy, and a fair probability that Tithes were paid early also.</p>
               <p n="23">§. 23. PAg. 459. It was no less than the wonderful Grace and Providence of God, that the Apostles even in their first Preaching of a Doctrine so unlikely to take in an evil World, should be so plentifully provided for, that they did not need Tithes, when they had no convenience to receive them. The Believers sold all, and as that Phrase <hi>[laying it at their Feet]</hi> imports, put the price into the Apostles power, who were Judges of every mans need, and had the absolute power of disposing, that which was dedicated to God. I have proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> that this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary renouncing of Propriety reached far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and lasted longer than the Apostles daies, for even <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaks of such a Community in his time. <hi>Apol.</hi> cap. 39. <hi>p.</hi> 31. And if it were not practised in other places, yet even there the Apostles had liberal presents and rewards, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 8. <hi>Phil.</hi> iv. 18. so that St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s labouring and wants, was the effect of his refusing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive supplies, for special reasons appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate to that time. Wherefore while this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary way continued, even Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> thinks they had no need of Tithes; see his
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:200297:254"/>
                  <hi>Review,</hi> p. 362. But now if Ministers be pressed to follow the Apostles Example (as my Friend rightly observes) the People must do as the Believers did then: The Example shews both what the People gave then, and what the Ministers did receive, and if it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige on one side, it must do so also on the other; yea, since Giving must be before Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, the Ministers cannot be obliged to follow the Apostles Example in being content to receive such a Maintenance, till the people begin first and do as the Believers then did; and we (who believe this to be an extraordinary Example, and so not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging either Priests or People now) will not press them to sell all, and put the price in our power; if they do it, they shall do it as freely as the Believers did then; and till they do so, 'tis certain we are under no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity to receive such a Maintenance as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, nor (I think) never will be offered us, yet, if it were (because <hi>T. E.</hi> loves to make wild suppositions) I think no man will say we quitted our Tenth when we received that and the Nine parts also, for <hi>Omne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus continet in se minus;</hi> and he that receives a Tithable Estate, given freely to his Church, surely doth not quit his Tithe of that Estate, for he now hath that and the Estate together. In the rest of this Section he follows me as <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> did <hi>Xenophon,</hi> raising Fire and Smoak at a distance, but avoids all close en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters. As for our War, it is no other but only defensive, to preserve what we pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess,
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:200297:255"/> and they raise the War that invade other mens Rights, and if they suffer in so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just a cause, they ought to blame no body but themselves.</p>
               <p n="24">§. 24. PAg. 464. I had so much charity for my Adversaries, that I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to shew them, they might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sin pay their Tithes imposed by the Kings Laws, even though they believed they were not due, by reckoning it as a piece of Passive Obedience, which I thought they might very well do, who count them a part of their own Estate unjustly taken from them. 'Tis true, the Law enjoyns them actually to set out their Tithe, and so it doth, that a man who is fined (even when he thinks his Fine unjustly imposed) shall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate this sum from the rest of his Money, and actually tender it; and yet his paying that Fine is a piece of Passive Obedience: And there are but few instances of Passive Obedience, wherein the submitting Party doth not do some Acts; as, going towards the Stocks, or the Prison, tendring his Fine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Acts do not change the nature of the Obedience, nor make it Active. It is a suffering, no doubt, to part with that which a man accounts his own, be it Corn, Hay, Money, or any thing else; and since the Law (by threatning treble damages) forces him to separate this Part of that which he calls his own Goods; it is no voluntary act in him, his will doth not consent, and 'tis
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:200297:255"/> consent only which can make a thing sinful; so that this Payment seems to me to be a a piece of Passive Obedience in a Quaker, and no sin. But I shall not contend about words, having proved before by divers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances and Arguments, <hi>That a man may sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to a payment which he thinks unjust, without sin:</hi> So did our Saviour in the Case of the Tribute, <hi>Matth.</hi> xvii. which he made <hi>Peter</hi> actively procure and tender, and yet declared he did not think it due; nor was this a Civil Tribute to the <hi>Romans</hi> as <hi>T. E.</hi> mistakes, but a Religious Tax for the use of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; see <hi>Ham.</hi> Annot. in loc. And Christ's words do plainly declare as much, for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Tribute to the King of Heaven whose only Son Jesus was, therefore he had no right to it. <hi>If the King's of the World, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no Tribute of their own Children, but of Strangers</hi> (so their Subjects are called in comparison of Sons who are so much nearer to them) <hi>what reason is there that the King of Heaven should receive it of me his Son?</hi> For this Tribute was paid to the Priests and the Temple. <hi>Theophylact.</hi> in loc. Now Christ did no Sin, and yet he paid this Tax even when he had proved it was unjustly demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of him: Therefore if the Quakers could prove Tithes unjust, they would not sin in paying them; yea, if they will be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Christ, they must pay them rather than offend the Demanders, and the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that requires them. Again, the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians paid all sorts of Custom and
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:200297:256"/> Tribute under the <hi>Roman</hi> Heathen Emperors, though some of these went to uphold a false Worship, and were employed about Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>The Tributes and Customs appointed by you, we every where, and in the first place, pay to your Officers, as we have been taught by Christ,</hi> saith <hi>Justin. Mart.</hi> Apol. 2. p. 64. The poor <hi>Greeks</hi> do the like to the Grand Signior, though he spend part of that Tribute on his <hi>Mahometan</hi> Worship. And I can now po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively affirm, that not only the <hi>French</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, but others of the Reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on who are allowed to live in Popish Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where Tithes are due by Law, do all pay their Tithes to the Popish Clergy, and yet they neither partake of their Ministry, nor like it; no more did many of the Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists, in the late Rebellion, like the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and Ministry of those times, and yet they paid their Tithes to them, and so do the Papists to us now. These latter instances <hi>T. E.</hi> can say nothing against, and they are direct to the Case, and shew that the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Practice of all but Quakers declares, it is no sin to submit to a payment imposed by lawful Authority, though we think it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly imposed. The thing being thus made out, I leave it to the Quakers to do what they please; I need not cogg with those, whom the Law compels; but if <hi>T. E.</hi> or any other of them turn again and rent me, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing my Charity with the name of Cogging, I shall leave them to their silly but cruel Guides, who against all Reason and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:200297:256"/> expose the poor wretches to Prisons and forfeitures, by making them believe a Lye, <hi>viz.</hi> that what Jesus himself, and the best Christians have done, is a sin: And doubtless all they suffer, is a just penalty for their believing such blind Guides as <hi>T. E.</hi> who hath not brought us one good instance to prove it a sin to submit to an unjust pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but binds the miserable Quakers Fetters on with Straws and Rushes, a few petty Cavils: For may not a man as innocently separate his Tithes as his Fine? May not he set out his Tithes with his own hand as lawfully as go to Prison on his own legs? Though a man may not put himself to Death, yet he may stretch out his hand and give notice he is ready, as well as go to the place of Execution without sin, or without the guilt of inflicting a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on himself, even though he die by an unjust Sentence; if it were sin in the Law commanding, 'tis none in the Party who is compelled by Law to do these things. And for a mans circumcising himself or sacrificing, these are Ceremonies expresly repealed in the New Testament, which Tithes are not, nor are they (as now paid) any Ceremonies at all, as is abundantly proved. And it is ridiculous for <hi>T. E.</hi> to say Tithes were a part of the Offerings which by the One Offerings to were ended; for those were Offerings to expiate sin, and so were not Tithes reputed, no not under <hi>Moses</hi> Law; yet, these poor shifts and old baffled Cavils are all he hath to oppose to the common consent of all the
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:200297:257"/> Christian World; and if this stuff will fright the Quakers into sufferings which they might innocently avoid, they deserve no pity.</p>
               <p n="25">§. 25. PAg. 470. That Tithes do afford 30000 l. <hi>per Ann.</hi> to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> the Quaker dare not deny, and cannot disprove. And to those who love their King and Country, and desire the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and welfare of both, this is one good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, among many others, why Tithes should be continued, which contribute so considerably toward the publick defence, by a standing Revenue, from which Lay-pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions are free, and yet bear an equal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, with other Estates of Assessments laid on by Parliament. And if <hi>T. E.</hi> said more words against Tenths, yet the sense of his Objection was no more but only, <hi>That this Flower once stuck in the Pope's Miter:</hi> and did not the Supremacy it self once do so? Did not Investitures and Collations to Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical preferments once stick there? Yea, the <hi>English</hi> Crown it self in King <hi>John</hi>'s daies was once in the Popish possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and should his Majesty, for that reason, now renounce it, and all these Rights of it, as well as the Revenue of First-fruits and Tenths? Yet we have Examples of First-fruits and Tenths paid to our <hi>English</hi> Kings, before the Pope had them stuck in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Spelman</hi> mentions the Tenths paid to King <hi>Richard</hi> the First, <hi>An.</hi> 1189. adding,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:200297:257"/>
                  <hi>That by this Example after Kings had the like.</hi> Spelm. <hi>Glossar. verb.</hi> Decimae Saladinae, p. 166. And there is another instance of First-fruits given to the Crown by a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Anno</hi> 1307. Whereas <hi>Walsingham</hi> (who goes the highest) places the usual payment of them to the Pope out of this Nation, <hi>Anno</hi> 1316. And <hi>T. E.</hi> may now read more than ever he read before, <hi>viz.</hi> that First-fruits and Tenths stuck in the <hi>English</hi> Crown before <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth stuck them there. Nor is it a light Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the continuance of Tithes among considering men, that out of them the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy pay a Tribute which owns the King's Supremacy over them, and testifies their subjection to the Crown; for Tribute hath been the most usual and approved way of owning Supremacy, and they who pay it may expect Protection from that Crown which they help to support, by these as well as other publick payments. As for <hi>T. E</hi>'s fancy, that if Tithes were taken away, the People would be more able to bear the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick charges of the Nation, I dare assure him he makes them gape for a morsel, that will fall beside their mouthes; King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth at the Dissolution, pretended he would use the Lands and Tithes then given him, to the glory of God, and the profit of the Common-wealth. <hi>Spelm.</hi> of <hi>Tithes,</hi> cap. 29. pag. 166. But no such use were they put to; yea, the People in many places are now forced by Subscriptions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions,
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:200297:258"/> to maintain their Ministers (that were richly provided for before, and were not burdensome to any) and yet they pay their Tithes to Lay-hands besides, and 'tis well known that the poor (before taken care of out of the Revenues then alienated) are now left to the People to maintain. Thus also, <hi>The Prince of</hi> Orange <hi>promised the</hi> Boors <hi>of</hi> Holland, <hi>that if they would consent to let the State have their Tithes towards the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the War with</hi> Spain, <hi>if they prosper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the War, the People should pay no more Tithes to their Ministers: But when the War was ended, and they expected to be Exempted, they were told, Tithes were so considerable a Revenue, that the State could not well subsist without them,</hi> Trelayne <hi>Treatise of Tithes, p.</hi> 26. So that if Tithes were taken from the Clergy, they would not fall to the Peoples share, either the Prince or the Great men would seize them, and if Landlords could get them, they would improve their Rents thereby, and leave the Tenants to maintain their Minister, and pay their publick charges beside, without that help they now have by the Clergies contributing thereunto, so that they would have more Brick to make and no Straw; and this is that wise Project which our Quakers drive at.</p>

                  <pb n="467" facs="tcp:200297:258"/>§. 26. PAg. 473. The beginning of this Section is nothing else but vain brags, and nauseous repetitions, and the sum of it is, that if the Reader will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that I have not made out any of my Titles to Tithes, and that he hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved them all, then Ministers are Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. He may perhaps meet with a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker so ridiculous as to grant him all this, but I dare say no other Reader out of <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam</hi> (as his own Phrase is) can he justly hope to meet with so strangely credulous. Whatever is like Argument I have answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, and discovered the mistakes which he dresses in other words, and brings upon the Stage again: so that I shall only tell him my threefold Cord is not so easily bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken▪ And he that conceals my Arguments, and falls upon my Conclusions, may prove himself a slip-string, not a Breaker of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Cords. But as to the present Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Whether the Ministers be the Peoples Hirelings?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> He seems to grant, the People do not set them on work, and that shews they are not their Hirelings; and though he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it is unjust to take wages of them that do not set us on work. I Answer, that the People do not set Souldiers, nor many other publick Officers appointed by the King on work, and yet they justly pay them Wages,
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:200297:259"/> because they do (in their way) work for them, though they be not set on work by them: But in our Case,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The People do not pay us out of their own, for <hi>God would not have us live of the People, that they might not be puffed up,</hi> saith <hi>Theophyl.</hi> Com. in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. 14. We live upon that part which is God's due ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally, upon that which was freely given to the Ministry long ago, upon that which the Law hath as firmly settled on us as any mans Estate is settled on him, upon that which the Landlord never purchased, nor doth the Tenant pay Rent for it, that is, we live upon that which is God's and our own, and belongs to no man else: <hi>Neither Landlords nor Farmers</hi> (as to Tithes paid to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters) <hi>are now</hi> (saith a Learned Bishop) <hi>the Proprietors or Donors, who are but only Trustees, Executors, and payers of a publick Debt laid upon those Estates and Land which they now hold,</hi> &amp;c. —and a little after— <hi>The Tithes they pay are no more theirs than a Legacy is the Liberality of the Executors.</hi> B. <hi>Gaud.</hi> Min. Maint. <hi>p.</hi> 28. and thus we see the People neither set them on work, nor pay them out of their own. The God who sends us, pays us out of his own Part, and our pious Ancestors secured this part to the Ministry by voluntary Donation and good Laws, Ancient and Modern, which give us a Civil Right to our Maintenance, and make that our own by Human Laws,
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:200297:259"/> which was our due by God's Law before, and can a man be a Hireling who takes his own? The Quaking Speakers indeed are Hirelings, in our Saviours sense, <hi>For the Sheep are not their own,</hi> John x. 12. some straggling Sheep set them on work, and pay them their Wages too, and these flee from place to place, though no such violence be used to them, as was to the late Loyal suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Clergy. And if those worthy Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors be aspersed by the Quaker as Hirelings for diserting their Flocks (as he falsly sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests) when Armed men violently seized them, and clapt them into Prisons: What will his Friends prove, who flee from one Meeting-house, and one County to another, heeding no particular Flock, but scraping from all they come amongst? As to my Friends note, that he may as well call the Judges Hirelings, and say they sell Justice. I think he made good the Parallel: for if a Salary or Maintenance settled, make men Hirelings and Sellers of Duties, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in one Capacity, it doth so in another, yea, in all Capacities; only <hi>T. E.</hi> for fear of the Temporal Sword, dares not speak so plain against the Civil Magistrates. The Judges are Ministers and Servants of God as well as we, they represent him, and Act in his name in Temporals, as we in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals; and if their settled Maintenance paid them for Administring Justice, do not make them Hirelings, neither doth ours
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:200297:260"/> prove us so; yea, we have this advantage that they are paid by him that sets them on work, but we are provided for by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance long since given to us. The rest of this Discourse is to tell us, that in his Opinion (which signifies little after it hath been so oft convicted of mistakes) we are no Gospel Ministers, nor content with that Maintenance, which (according to his idle fancy) our Master allowed us. To this he adds that gross discovery of his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, about Parishes choosing their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and inveighs against the Priests about Curates, who, to be sure, are none of the Peoples Hirelings; but this being nothing to the Question deserves no Answer.</p>
               <p n="27">§. 27. PAg. 481. That the Quakers ought to pay Tithes notwithstanding their separation, because they separate vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, is shewed before. And all that is new here, is a pretended Cause of their separation, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Vice</hi> of the <hi>Minister,</hi> for he asks in way of arguing (and such Questions are the most vigorous sort of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations) <hi>If the Minister be a man of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and Intemperate Life, and of a disorderly Conversation, such as the Apostle hath exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to withdraw from, is not the Minister then to blame for the Separation?</hi> 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the first place, that this Plea will not justifie those who separate from vertuous
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:200297:260"/> Ministers, and yet Quakers separate from these as well as from the Vicious; so that I noted before, the Ministers Vice is but a pretence for them who resolved to separate however; now <hi>T. E.</hi> being unable to clear his Quakers of this Hypocrisie, pretends I did not Answer his Question; wherefore I now add, That a Vicious Minister is to blame for his Vice, but (as St. <hi>Augustine</hi> largely proves against the <hi>Donatists</hi>) the People who separate on that account, are to blame for the Separation; for the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are God's, and the Grace that makes them effectual is his, and he can work by incompetent Instruments, besides private Persons are to expect the sentence of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, it is not their duty to correct their Pastors faults; and till they whose Office it is do correct them, they are to mind their own Duty, and must not sin by separating, because another sins; the Priest must an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for his Vice, and the Superiour for his connivance, and so must the Hearer also for his Schism, for every man shall bear his own burden: But we must not expatiate into this Question; wherefore we will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly note, <hi>First,</hi> What pitiful Equivocation the Quaker uses to excuse his Friends from separating from vertuous Ministers, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending now he would be understood as reflecting not on our Conversation but our Ministry, and so he will not grant any of us are good Ministers; This is a shifting the
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:200297:261"/> Scene, for are not his own words, <hi>A man of Vicious and Intemperate Life, and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conversation?</hi> It was a bad Life, and not false Doctrine, which he pretended was the cause of their Separation; and it was not our Ministry but our Conversation he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on, howsoever he would deny it now. But as to our Ministry, the Quakers are no fit Judges of it, and those who are, esteem our Ministry good. St. <hi>Augustine</hi> observes, that Separatists are usually the weakest sort of Men, <hi>They are the chaff that are so soon blown out of God's Floor,</hi> saith he; and are these competent Judges? <hi>Secondly,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly taxed our pretender to Inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for abusing Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> this 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> iii. 6. —<hi>withdraw from every</hi> Brother <hi>that walketh disorderly;</hi> which the Quaker ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to the Peoples withdrawing from their Ministers, whereas the word <hi>[Brother]</hi> there, plainly shews it is meant of their withdrawing from disorderly fellow-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, not from Fathers, as Ministers are called in <hi>Scripture,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 15. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> ii. 11. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> v. 1. We indeed (as the Apostles did) call the People Brethren; but Scripture affords no instance of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers calling their Ministers Brother; and here 'tis plain St. <hi>Paul</hi> only speaks how Christians should carry it to other private Christians in case of Vice, but he never gave the People power (of their own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) to withdraw from their Minister;
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:200297:261"/> and though the Apostle wished, no doubt, the <hi>Galatians</hi> should withdraw from false Teachers; yet, he intimates those false Teachers must first be cut off by Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, <hi>Galat.</hi> v. 2. For He (whom Christ had made a Judge in this Case) was first to declare them false Teachers; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our Quakers expect no Sentence or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration from Authority, but though least able, are most forward to censure their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, and then excuse one sin by another, their Separation by their rash censuring their Superiours. As for his railing and evil sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of me, I wish <hi>T. E.</hi> had no more need to make an Apology for an Ill man, than I have for a bad Minister; and as <hi>Seneca</hi> speaks, <hi>If</hi> Marcus Cato, <hi>wise</hi> Laelius, <hi>or one of the</hi> Scipio<hi>'s had said this, I should have been troubled:</hi> But 'tis a Quaker rails at me and suspects me—<hi>and alas, 'tis their old Disease, they speak not what I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, but what they are wont to speak of all those of my Profession.</hi>

<pb n="474" facs="tcp:200297:262"/> ordered those who went to Preach to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, if they did not receive them, to shake off the Dust of their feet against them. And it was to Unbelievers that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> used this Ceremony, <hi>Acts</hi> xiii. 51. and so is no rule for our proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in a settled Church among professed Christians, for these must be judged by the Church, if they do amiss, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 12. Nor <hi>Secondly,</hi> will that other place, <hi>Acts</hi> xiii. 46. (where the Apostles turn from the Unbelieving Jews) do the Quakers any service, unless he will reckon his Quakers among those Unbelieving Jews, who judged themselves unworthy of Eternal Life, as that very Text speaks; which <hi>T. E.</hi> was so sensible of, that in this <hi>Second Book</hi> he durst not cite the words of that Scripture again, but shuffles in other words, to which I did not refer in this Note: But I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced an Express Text, where there is a Command, <hi>To compel them to come in,</hi> Luk. xiv. 23. <hi>i. e.</hi> to hear the Gospel there signified by a great Feast; this so galls the Quaker that he takes huge Pains to wrest this plain place, as Hereticks usually deal with Scripture, <hi>Cum ipsi nolunt corrigi, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam volunt depravari.</hi> Aug. He tells us of a new sort of <hi>Compulsion by fair means;</hi> and cites many Texts where he pretends such compelling is spoken of; but he is still mistaken, for in some of these Texts, <hi>Luke</hi> xxiv. 28, 29. and <hi>Acts</hi> xvi. 15. and
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:200297:262"/> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 14. There is neither the same word in the <hi>English,</hi> nor in the <hi>Greek,</hi> which St. <hi>Luke</hi> useth in the place urged by me, 'tis not [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] in any of these, nor is Translated <hi>[Compel]</hi> but <hi>[constrain]</hi> and so these are nothing to the purpose, where we enquire of the sense of the word [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>]: And his other Texts where the <hi>English</hi> is <hi>[compel]</hi> and where that <hi>Greek</hi> word is used, do all imply, <hi>The forcing men to do something against their will:</hi> as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 11. It was much against the mind of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to glory, but the <hi>Corinthians</hi> forced him to it whether he would or no. And <hi>Peter</hi> compelled the <hi>Gentiles</hi> against their will (for they were very averse to Jewish Rites) to live as did the Jews, <hi>Gal.</hi> xi. 14. And Christ's Disciples had no mind to leave him but he forced them to depart, <hi>Matth.</hi> xiv. 22. <hi>Mark</hi> vi. 45. Yea, there are other Texts where this very word, <hi>viz.</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] is used for forcing men by Terror of Laws and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, <hi>Acts</hi> xxvi. 11. <hi>Chap.</hi> xxviii. 19. and whereas <hi>T. E.</hi> talks of compelling by loving invitations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> let us but apply his own words, to one of his own Texts, and then we shall see how little Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he makes of abusing Scripture to serve his base ends. Did the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 11. compel St. <hi>Paul</hi> to glory by kind <hi>Invitations, loving Intreaties, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Perswasions, and Demonstrative Reasons?
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:200297:263"/> How ridiculous is this Exposition?</hi> There is therefore more intended by the word <hi>[Compel]</hi> than the Quaker is willing to allow, and since St. <hi>Matthew</hi> useth the word <hi>[Bid]</hi> they may well stand together, and justifie the method we now go in, to call and invite dissenters first, and if they refuse, then to compel them; as for the man that was speechless 'tis possible he might come in by bidding [for St. <hi>Matthew</hi> only speaks of him not St. <hi>Luke</hi>] or if not, yet those who compelled him, told him of the danger of coming unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and that left him without excuse. Thus much for that Exposition which is not mine only but St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s, in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining whereof the Quaker hath shewed neither Reason nor Truth. But as to the thing, supposing there were no express Precept in Scripture for this compulsion, yet if a Christian Magistrate (who is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Christ to punish evil doers, <hi>Rom.</hi> xiii. 4. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 14.) finding Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration mischievous to mens Souls, and Conventicles dangerous to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, do by Laws and Penalties compel men to come to the publick Worship where God's Word is Read and Preached, and his Sacraments Administred; these Laws do give us sufficient Power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the refractory. But then both St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> and I do suppose the thing to be good in it self, to which men are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled,
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:200297:263"/> and if it be so, 'tis no matter whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Party compelled judge it so or no; and it is the Compellers duty to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that the thing be good really and in it self. And to prove this is the duty of a Christian Prince I did before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Theodosius,</hi> and I add now <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius,</hi> whose Laws are yet extant to punish obstinate Hereticks, if they did not return to the Church; Were not these Christian Princes? And was it not the true Christian Faith to which these Hereticks were compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led? Wherefore it doth not hence follow that they are innocent who compel men to a false Religion, such as Popery is; no, nor yet that the Popish Fire and Fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got is lawful, because pious Emperours used lesser Penalties to a good purpose: <hi>T. E.</hi> knows I did declare against Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Punishments in Case of Religion, and yet he would not cite my Opinion at large, that he might falsly accuse me and revile me, so that I may say to him as he in the Comoedian, <hi>There is nothing but it may be depraved, if we take away that which is good, and repeat only what may seem evil.</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired my Adversary to Read St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>'s Fiftieth Epistle, where he might have found, that blessed Father was as well against Popish Capital punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as Fanatick Libertinism, and by Arguments not easily answered he proves
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:200297:264"/> it the duty of Christian Princes to make Laws to compel men to the True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <hi>For what sober man will say to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious King, It doth not belong to you in your Kingdom to take care who Oppresses or Impugns the Church of your great Lord, it is nothing to you whether men will be Religious or Sacrilegious?</hi> And when the <hi>Donatists</hi> ask, <hi>Who Christ compelled?</hi> He replies, he compelled St. <hi>Paul</hi> into the Church by Terror, and Ordered his Messengers to compel others, <hi>Luk.</hi> xiv. Observing that when the <hi>Persian</hi> King made a Law against Blaspheming the true God, a Blasphemer might as well have called that Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as Separatists who <hi>divide the Members of Christ, and vilifie his Sacraments, and then glory of Persecution, because they are forbid to do this by the Imperial Laws,</hi> &amp;c. This and much more than <hi>T. E.</hi> can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, he may find in that Epistle: To which I shall only add, that this Coercive power is so necessary to keep evil men in Awe, that when the Church wanted Christian Magistrates, and could have no assistance from the Laws of Princes to restrain such Offenders, God gave the Ministers a miraculous Power to inflict Corporal punishments upon those whom they Excommunicated for their Crimes, for Satan did seize those, and torture them with strange distempers, who were under the Church censures, as we may
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:200297:264"/> gather from <hi>Acts</hi> xiii. 11. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 5. where the Phrase of <hi>Delivering over to Satan for the destruction of the Flesh, is thus to be understood.</hi> Hieron. <hi>Com. in loc.</hi> Theophylact. <hi>ibid. and</hi> Ham. <hi>Annot. in loc.</hi> So that 'tis plain God will work a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle (where ordinary means are wanting) rather than obstinate Offenders shall not be compelled to repent and amend; and this justifies our moderate Penalties in an ordinary way, when that extraordinary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod is ceased.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 495. Though the Quaker urge the Precepts which Christ gave to those he sent, as obligatory to us, yet he is so inconsistent with himself, that he spoils all his Arguments again, by saying, <hi>I (and my Brethren,</hi> I suppose) <hi>are none of those Christ sent;</hi> and if we be not, why doth he press us with those Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts? This is not unlike the Mad-man in <hi>Constantinople</hi> mentioned by <hi>Nicetas,</hi> who fancied he was killing Serpents, when he was breaking his own Pitchers to pieces: As for our Mission, 'tis not one jot the less Authentick for <hi>T. E</hi>'s impudent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it. But I suppose he will grant Christ sent St. <hi>Paul;</hi> and yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares Christ had given him power to demand a Maintenance of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Church in general, not excepting but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:200297:265"/> those who were fallen off to false Teachers, as I proved before; which shews, that those who had once received the Apostles, and still professed themselves Christians, were bound to maintain the Apostles of Christ, though they had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen false Teachers to themselves. 'Tis true, they had then no Christian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates nor Laws to compel refusers; yet, then the Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> asserts his Right; and St. <hi>Peter</hi> by a miraculous Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercive Power severely punishes <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> for keeping back part of that which themselves pretended to give for Maintenance of the Church. And can we think if these Apostles had lived under Christian Princes, where others had given a Maintenance, and Laws had declared it due to the Ministers, they would not have allowed the Executing those Laws upon the detainers of those Dues? We have proved that the Maintenance we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, is our own, our due by God's Law, by the Donation of the owners of those Lands out of which these profits arise, by the Laws of the Church and the State also, and Christ bids Quakers render to all their Dues; which Precept, if they despise and will not pay to us that which is due to us by so many Titles, they ought to be compelled to be Honest, even against their wills. Jesus no where for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids the punishing those who invade others
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:200297:265"/> Rights, nor did he intend to protect such as break his Laws, as well as the Laws of man; by refusing to render men their Dues: if we had no more but a Civil Right to Tithes we might as lawfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel men to pay them by Temporal Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, as other men may do who have no other Title to their Estates, much more when the Civil-Right is strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Divine Right also.

Yet the Quaker loudly complains of me for giving him ill language, in that Book where he reviles the Primitive Fathers, our <hi>Saxon</hi> Ancestors, our Judges and Laws, and the whole Order of Clergy, and heaps all the reproach and contempt upon me that his malice could inspire him withal: For the Epithetes he complains of, there was just occasion for me to use them as the Reader may see, if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult the particular places, and to call Evil men by their deserved names, is no railing, no more than it was in St. <hi>John</hi> to call the Pharisees, <hi>A Generation of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</hi> They must be angry at themselves for deserving such Titles, not at me for justly bestowing them. But whatever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men say or think of the Quakers, they have so good a conceit of themselves, that they fancy they are like the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians, which is a certain Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (to men of knowledge) they either do not know them, or do not know themselves; for Light and Darkness are not more contrary: Surely if <hi>T.

As for himself, he slips his own Neck out of the Collar by pretending that I put him upon proving Negatives, and yet in this very Conclusion he Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters up I know not how many [No's, Not's, and Never's] which he would have us believe he hath proved; and are these Affirmatives? This then is a meer evasion; and since 'tis certain the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians had Sacraments, distinct Orders of Clergy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea, and paid Tithes; he might easily have got off from that Rock, by proving, That the Quakers had Sacraments, distinct Orders of Clergy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and paid Tithes also; but indeed he did not justifie the Parallel because he could not; that must remain the true reason. By this time I hope it appears that my Adversary is so unlike to other men, and so differing from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that it ought to be no wonder if I had charged him in one place with Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Folly, and in another, with Politick Equivocation and Sophistry, for he hath shewed his Ignorance in Authors, and all solid Learning, his folly in innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Childish mistakes; and yet in other places, his catching at Phrases,
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:200297:267"/> concealing such parts of his Quotations as make against him, and his fallacious arguings demonstrate he spared not to use all the Sophistry and Equivocation he was Master of, in this Cause; Nay, in some of these last Pages, we have an instance both of his Folly in undertaking, and his Equivocation in managing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of that notorious abuse of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>viz.</hi> his Friends Exposition of <hi>The Priests bear Rule by their means,</hi> that is, as they expound, by their Estates.
